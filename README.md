this is a project to create pet descriptions, translate them from English to Dutch, and enhance the descriptions.

for running the project you should run the app.py files in ai_server, interface_server, and orchestrator_server at the same time. 

You should also have the models in a folder named AI in the ai_server folder. Please contact hiwafeiziii@gmail.com to get the models (they are not iploaded to their large sizes).

We also included the code we used to train the models in the "AI training code" folder.

you can learn more about the project in the project details folder.
