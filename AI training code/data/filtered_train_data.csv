I rescued a couple of cats a few months ago but could not get them neutered in time as the clinic was fully scheduled. The result was this little kitty. I do not have enough space and funds to care for more cats in my household. Looking for responsible people to take over Nibble's care.

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Female,Black,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,1,0,"Charlie was rescued by dogs! A friend was walking his dogs when they suddenly became excited outside an apartment complex and sniffed out a shoe box. Inside the shoe box was little Charlie! He was about 6 weeks old then, emaciated and dehydrated, just a scrap of skin and bones. He had a bad tummy virus but survived it after two weeks of antibiotics. Now he needs a permanent home! Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail. Charlie is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Charlie are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Prison is punishment! Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please. I want Charlie to be loved his whole life :)"

Dog,Rottweiler,Male,Black,Large,Short,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,1,0,"I am looking for a loving permanent home for Kaiser. Kaiser is a really amazing, sweet and funny dog. He is very loving and affectionate, who loves and NEEDS attention. He needs someone that will treat him like part of the family and the sweet dog he is. He grew up with 2 cats and another small dog. he loves cats however it takes him awhile to respond well to new dogs. He never really socialized with children before, so if you have kids I would suggest meeting Kaiser with them before making a decision.He grew up mostly as an indoor dog but can do well outside if there is a shady place for him to relax during the hot parts of the day. NO Cage, No chain! please note that Kaiser is a family pet not guard dog. Kaiser is a pure breed rottweiler, he has his MKA certificate, basic dog obedience training certificate and a good citizens award metal. He also knows almost all the tricks: sit, stay, shake etc.and is a super fast learner. The reason I have to give him up for adaption is, Im an expat who was living in Malaysia for 5 years, I had to leave and unfortunately I was unable to take Kaiser with me (his breed was band in the country I moved to). I'm looking for someone to give him a permanent loving home. Kaiser is one of those dogs that crave that best friend relationship with his owner. so if you think he sounds like a good match for you please email me. my number is not available as I am out of the country, Kaiser is staying with my friend in Selangor for now."

She has greyish black fur with a white undercoat. I don't know how else to describe it. She looks dark grey but if you brush her fur up its all white underneath.. She's no more than 2 years old, still a young lady. She's an affectionate and intelligent cat that prefers a quiet, mellow environment. I think her type of coat coloring is called Black Smoke. The little black tabby with striped legs is Luna. She's a female kitten, about 3 weeks old now and looks just like her mummy. She's the lazier of the two kittens. She loves sleeping and cuddling up with Snowy all day. The silver tabby is Rajah. I've named him after Princess Jasmine's pet tiger in Disney's Aladdin cartoon. He's more adventurous than his cozy, comfort-loving sister. Every time I check on them, he's awake and looking at me with wide eyes. The kittens will be ready for adoption in about 4-6 weeks time, once they are fully weaned and litter-trained. Snowy will be ready for adoption once her kittens are fully weaned and she has been spayed. - Set up a meeting with me and the pet of your choice. - We'll have a chat and see if you and kitty are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated.

Although I do volunteer with the Selangor SPCA in my free time, I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Interested parties can text or email me. A brief introduction of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated."

Very soft fur coat! Very playful! Some videos: Giant and his tennis ball- Giant playing with Snoopy- Giant being bullied- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Due to the overwhelming response from my last email (I got close to emails/ sms/ calls), I am sorry but I need to lay down some ground rules. Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this email and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the terms and conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many emails from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. 1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. 2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. 3) Please DO NOT delete my email with all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. 4) This email is dated 2 February . This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. 5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 5 points, please read on: 6) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. 7) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email): - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with: - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before 8) No reservations please. First come first served. 9) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. 10) If you need clarifications, please call Ryan at."

We recently found out that the timid mummy that we have been feeding actually gave birth to 7 puppies, but roughly 2 weeks ago, one heartless human being took one stick & jolok the hole near longkang where the puppies have been seeking refuge.

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Golden,Medium,Short,No,No,No,Healthy,1,200,"This kitten which I named him Brave,was lying lifeless under the dark staircase of my condo. I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo. Brave is really a miracle to me, he really wants to survive and he does ! Try to look at the pictures that i attached, his eyes are full of fighting spirit..........

My new foster took me home, my eyes hardly see anything and almost blind because of the tick fever. I went to doctor, and my eyes is getting better now. My new fosterer gave me heart guard and apply front line on me. I am always horny that's why I can't get along with my new foster female dog.

She has no discernible injuries or health problems, only malnourished. No ticks or fleas. Today, after a few rounds of Whiskas kitten food, a bath and a clean environment, she is bright-eyed and stronger; plays like any normal kitten. She is unafraid of people and loves nothing more than to be with people. She is now toilet-trained on a sandbox. She also does not meow very much, behaves like an intelligent kitten instead of an annoying howler, loves to be petted, purrs an awful lot. Nobody has come forward to claim her, and efforts to find a home for her on FB is still fruitless. Tiggy will be an easy cat to care for, as she is independent yet loving, toilet trained and quite neat. She needs some love and attention, responsible owners who will neuter her and give her the security and care she deserves. I will only be in Malaysia for a few weeks, so am now URGENTLY looking - and hoping - for a home for Tiggy. She deserves better than to be a street cat, left to die or get run over.

When people go near him, he will run away too. There are many cars in that area, he can get knock down very easily. We managed to get him and send him to a dog shelter in Cheras. He is not aggressive at all, looks timid and insecure and did not make any noise (no barking). Unfortunately this dog shelter in Cheras is also very full, i begged them and they agree to temporary shelter him when I go look for fosterer or adopter.

Dog,English Bulldog,Male,Cream,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,1,0,"Hugo is an active and robust English bulldog that needs love and attention from the owner. Unfortunately for us, we are unable to provide him the attention that he deserves as we have full time jobs as well as 2 other dogs, a bird and 3 guinea pigs at home to care for! He is a pure pedigree English bulldog, has not been neutered and has been given full vacination as a puppy. Before he is given to his new home, we will give him another round of booster vacination if adviced by the doctor. He stays outside the house in our home at Damansara Heights as he likes running around exercising and due to that, he is not toilet-trained. He is however quite intelligent for a bulldog as he knows how to play throw and fetch and runs away when he knows he is going to get a scolding :) We love him tremendously, but unfortunately, we are not able to keep him. We hope we will be able to find a nice family for him (we would prefer if the family has no other dogs since Hugo can get over-friendly without knowing his size and strength. He also tends to get jealous easily). If there are anybody out there interested in adopting Hugo, please give me a call. We will also interview prospective adopters to see if Hugo is a suitable dog for them. If the need arises, we will also do house visits to see if the house will be a conducive for an active bulldog like Hugo.

Dog,Mixed Breed,Mixed,Brown,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,4,0,"Our rescued dog gave birth to six beautiful puppies in late October (), and though she refused to care for them, we fell in love with them immediately. They've all been very well cared for - we give them all the proper nutrition, exercise and plenty of attention. They come from good stock - dad is a lab/mix, and mother is a mongrel (rescued when she was a few weeks old). The mother is a very good guard dog, so we're hoping her pups will have inherited her instincts. We've given two puppies away, and so four remain. We can't keep them all, so we're looking for easy-going and kind homes for these little bundles of joy. We've got three males and a female - all very well behaved (well, about as well behaved as puppies can be!). One is off-white, the three others are varying shades of golden brown (see pics).

Don't ask me how I got stuck there, but I was so frightened, hungry and lost. I am safe now. My rescuer has put me on Avoderm and IAMS diet. She says I've got a good appetite. I have been Frontlined and dewormed too. I have just learned to use the litterbox, so give me a little bit more time and I'll be a pro at that (although my rescuer thinks I'm pretty good at it already)! My rescuer says that I'm very sweet. I've learned to warm up to humans and I love chin rubs and to be cuddled. I feel safe when I'm wrapped up in a blanket and held in someone's arms. I love to run after the cat teaser stick -- it's my favourite toy. I'm also quite good at playing the phone app for cats; it's cool...but nothing like giving the ol' feather stick a good chase! I promise I would make a wonderful kitty if I could grow up in a loving environment. The vet said I'm about 1.5 months old now and looking forward to a long and healthy life! Please contact my rescuer Aida at if you would like to adopt/foster me.

Dog,Mixed Breed,Male,Black,Medium,Short,No,Yes,No,Healthy,2,0,"Whatsapp or SMS only! (Calls will not be entertained as we do have jobs) if you are interested to ADOPT THE TWO PUPPIES TOGETHER. Do not message purely to ask if they are still available because if they have been adopted, we will update the status to Adopted. Do not contact us to adopt on behalf of someone else. You will not be entertained. Please read the following T&Cs for adoption before you contact us: Terms and Conditions: 1. Tell us why you would be the perfect adopter, and your experience with dogs, if you have any dogs currently, if you live in a landed property, and if everyone in the family is in agreement to adopt the puppies. 2. Must be treated as a member of the family and not as guard dogs. 3. Preferably kept indoors, but outdoors is fine as long as there is sufficient shelter from the heat and rain. 4. Must not cage or chain the dogs unecessarily for extended periods. 5. Must be fed good food and given water daily! (yes some people don't think this is important) 6. MUST be neutered at 6 months of age. A refundable deposit of RM per puppy will be collected for this. 7. MUST be given medical care by a vet if required. 8. There will be a home inspection before the puppies are released to you. 9. MUST allow us to visit the pups twice after adoption - we will not impose on you and your family unnecessarily, and send us picture/video updates from time to time. 10. MUST not dump the dogs when it is no longer convenient to care for them. Remember a dog is for life. If you are unable to commit to care for the dogs for their entire lifetime, please do NOT adopt. ******************** These two gorgeous pups were dumped behind my vet's clinic. They are super playful, loves cuddles and loves to eat too! The two of them are very attached to each other, and are best buddies, so that's why I named them Ron Weasley & Harry Potter because they're inseparable! We hope that you can find it in your hearts to give these two rascals a good and loving home!"

We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Molly (3yr, female, neutered mother of Zee) and nova (male, 4 months old). As for Zee, he is 2yr, male, spayed. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other. I wish the next adopter is knowledgeable about cat behavior, as it will definitely require some period of time for the cats to adapt to the new environment, financially independent, best if your are staying in a landed property. For confirmed adopter, I can still arrange for meet up even if its out of Klang Valley. THANKS!"

We weren't intending of getting another dog after the pain we went through seeing our beloved dog passed away. But when we saw the state in which Lucky was in when he was found by our neighbour (wound marks on his neck and body), we had a change of heart. We knew Lucky needed us. We took him to the vet to be vaccinated. He was found to have heart worm hence the breathlessness which we noticed when we played with him. We got him treated. It was a stressful three months during the treatment period since he was not to be excitable for fear of getting a stroke. It was difficult because he was an energetic dog who gets happy and excited whenever we are around. Thankfully, he survived and has since been living a healthy life. Lucky is playful, loving and very loyal. He loves company and is very affectionate. He gets along well with kids. Our family will be relocating overseas and hence we are looking for a good owner who will offer him love and care."

Just like my sister, I am adventurous and very loving (we got this trait from our mummy). We love people and being around people, and playing with people and snuggling up to people, anything people related! Will you be my furever friend? _______________________________ Back story, we feed a bunch of strays in our area and did not manage to get one of the female dogs to be spayed in time so out pop-ed 5 little angles. We are still struggling to get our older foster dogs adopted so we thought it would be okay to leave this family where they were. But the weather was very unkind and it rained during most of the night. As a result, this furry family ended up not having a warm place to sleep at night so we decided to take them in, give them whatever we can. Unfornutely, 2 of the puppies did not make it. RIP. However, we have 3 very strong and bright puppies up for adoption, Winnie, Oreo and Minnie! They were born on June 29th (which makes them a month old today!) The mummy, QT Pie is also up for adoption! For more info, please contact Kelly Tan (preferably whatsapp) Thank you and have a great day!"

Dog,Mixed Breed,Male,Black,Medium,Short,No,No,No,Healthy,1,0,"The second puppy of Megan's first litter. Puma's the biggest pup out of the litter. He's healthy and he's a quiet type, un-neutered, 1 month old, and his coat is similar to a dark chocolate bar till he was about 3 weeks of age. Now it's greyish black! whenever he hears a foreign noise he does growl and puppy bark. Could be a good watch dog and companion! :) Just shower Puma with love and comfort, he'll definitely give back more. PUMA'S BIRTHDAY IS ON THE 21ST DECEMBER ! P/s : I recommend spaying/neutering Puma after the age of 2 years to avoid any health/growth abnormalities, which explains the pet being un-neutered. Conditions for adopting Puma: *Adopter must be attentive *RESPONSIBLE. Adopter should be willing to bare the expenses of future health probs (not just give up one day and leave/abandon the dog elsewhere) *Adopter must be caring, loving & thoughtful of their pet/pets *Like all dogs, Puma needs exercise so daily walks or plays during the week would be strongly necessary *Adopter must groom Puma occasionally *Adopter must be willing to vaccinate,de-worm & neuter Puma accordingly. *Adopter should be active in FB for the adopter to post photo's or updates about Puma to see how Puma is doing. *I may visit Puma un-occasionally at the adopter's place from time to time. *Adopter should bare in mind that once they adopt a pet, their responsibilities are forever so think well. I do not want Puma to end up abandoned in some place because the adopter can't be responsible enough. Please take good care of Puma."
Cat,Domestic Medium Hair,Male,Golden,Medium,Medium,No,Yes,No,Healthy,1,0,"This kitten was shivering near the lift at my apartment one day. Mommy cat was no where to be found. He followed me around while I was looking for mommy cat, then decided to follow me home. He has been dewormed and will be sent for vaccinations on the 19th of Oct. He is very affectionate and active, litter box-trained and learns fast. He has an adorable meow (more like ""eow!"") Most of the photos of him were taken while he was asleep, because he is hyperactive when he is awake! As no one is at home all day while I am at work, he is starved of attention, and is confined to a room in my tiny apartment. I leave him with many toys and play with him until I am exhausted every night, but he still looks like he is bursting with energy and sometimes tries to run away. Perhaps it is not enough for him :( I feel sorry for him, and hope that someone can give him a loving home which suits him, and all the attention he deserves!"

Dog,Mixed Breed,Female,Black,Small,Short,No,No,No,Healthy,1,0,"On Wednesday I was visiting PAWS in Ara Damansara to look for a new kitten for my family, when a gentleman arrived with very young pup he found on the side of the road lost from its mother. I offered to take it in to PAWS. Not knowing PAWS was closed on Wednesdays we then took the pup to the VET who confirmed she is a girl, healthy looking and between 7 to 10 days. We have been looking after her since Wednesday afternoon. She has been feeding very well and her urine and motion looks very healthy. She is very happy with her little tail wags and wriggling around the box. However, we live in a condo and due to personal/business life we are unable to look after or raise a dog. However, we do not want her to be put down or sent to shelter where she will most likely not survive. The poor little girl needs someone to hand raise her and give her the love and care she needs. If the right home for her needs financial support for her injections/vet/spade I am happy to help. **Update - it's been 5 days since I posted this and she is a super happy dog... lots of tail wags, she is very healthy... However she does need someone to be able to raise her and love her..."

My heart breaks to release them all. Since they were two months old, I slept with them every day until now. They are very close to me. Even I cried during writing this information. :'( But I cannot keep them all because I already have 11 cats for now. Due to limited space, this 4 baby is open for adoption. These cute baby should be an INDOOR cat only (I never let any of my cat out before, so they have not been expose to outdoor). Very sad to let them go actually~ Currently they are on Royal Canin for kitten. Let me tell you a little story about them. Miu Ciu, the youngest. Very naughty but spoiled. Have a short tail. The color is rather unique, where there are white, orange and cream colors. Oh yes, he likes to ""meow"" a lot. Small Black, the third born kitten. Look elegant and magnificent, probably because of its color. He is black and his hair is rather soft. His chest are white and also white-legged like wearing a socks. His eyes are always round as in ready for ""attacking"" mode. Orengy, second born kitten. A little careless and playful. His eyes were squinting. Long tail, orange tabby and white. The face looks confused, but also love to play. Lastly, Teleng. The first born kitten, getting severe flu when he was two months old, caused him a fever reaching 42 degrees celsius and even seizures. Now he's fully healed, but his head slightly tilted due to the fever. That's why he looks pretty cute with his shortcomings. Just like his brother, Teleng is black and white-legged. Anyone interested can contact me for pre-booking. This will also provide you some time to do the preparation before this two cute kitten come to your lovely home.

She was drinking from oil filled water spots and begging for food from stalls. She was always alone. It was such a pity for a little kitty like her and the danger of being run over was always there. I thought proving clean water & food would suffice, but I just couldn't leave her there. After a couple of days, took her back home and got her to the vet. Got her examined, especially her eye. The vet advised it could be self trauma or an accident that might have gotten her left eye, otherwise there is no sign of contagious bacteria or virus. She has been vaccinated, dewormed for the 1st round and given immune tabs to boost her immune as well. For the left eye, she was given a special kind of oilment to aid healing and also a maintenance to avoid any infection. She has been with me for about a month now. The eye doesn't bother her at all. She is a brave little survivor. She is healthier and more active than ever. I have another adult cat at home, and they just love to play and play. Juno is a very adorable loving cat... she just falls on your feet whenever she sees you to show how much she misses you and loves you. She is just a loveable little angel."

Quite vocal too if left alone for too long without pampering :) Additional details: Aslan's current diet is Royal Canin Babycat 34. He is very independent and clever with the litter-box.

Cat,Siamese,Male,Black,Medium,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,1,0,"(Urgent) This boy lives in the garage of my condo. I regularly catch the strays living around to neuter and vaccinate them. I did so with that boy last week. He is neutered and got his first vaccine shot. I am keeping him at home the time for him to heal properly. He is born in that garage, from a mix-siamese mum. His siblings disappeared but he stayed along with his mum. He has a really gentle nature so the other cats are bullying him. It turns out that he is really shy but loves being pet. With dome time, he will definitely get used to a family home. He already learnt how to use the litter. I can’t keep him as I already adopted 3 strays from downstairs that I will bring with me when I will leave Malaysia. So I am trying to see if I can find him a good family. I will keep him until the 10th of April. If by then I haven’t found a family, I will release him where I caught him. I will only let him go to a family that is not caging cats. Knowing where he comes from, caging will only make him unhappy. No outdoors, at least at the beginning, would be recommended. I am not going to ask you to pay for the neutering and vaccine, as I am willing to do it for giving strays a better life. All I will ask you is to keep the vaccination process on every year and to provide him a healthy and happy life. A cat lives an average of 15years. Please consider that if you adopt him. I am not getting him out of the streets to have him get back there in a few years."

""This dog is one of the dogs rescued from the Klang Pound in April just before D-day (when they are put to death).

It is unfortunate that due to the aggressiveness of the contracted dogcatchers, most of these beautiful dogs are not strays and previously had homes. Hence, most of them are sociable and loving.

Cat,Scottish Fold,Female,Cream,Small,Short,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,2,300,"We are relocating to Australia and due to strict animal importation laws, we might not be able to take one of our cats with us. We're seeking a potential adopter for the Cream Scottish Fold, while we continue to try our luck to bring the other cat with us. However, if the potential new family could give both cats a wonderful home, we would like both of them to be adopted together. Both cats are very close. They're mother and daughter. Separation will cause some distress to them so we don't want to do that unless it's absolutely necessary. Note: The cat for adoption is 2 years old and is currently recovering from a skin condition. Ideally, she will be better by the time she gets rehomed.. but if she doesn't. The potential adopter must promise to continue treatment. (We will supply the medication) The photo was taken before she fell sick. Below is a video of how she looks like now. (She needs patience from the new family to help her get better if she's not by the time of adoption.) The other cat is 3 years old. Both cats are quite shy and it takes them awhile to get used to strangers. But once they are comfortable with you, they're very sweet cats. All potential adopters will be screened and must agree to keep these cats indoors at all times. (No cages) They are apartment cats and have never been outside their entire lives. They do not know how to hunt and is incapable of killing anything. They are litter trained and don't scratch furniture if they have their large scratching pole and toys, which will be provided by us as well. Location: KLCC area. If you are interested in adopting our cats, please send us an email with a brief introduction about yourself and your family. Where you live (The area) and let us know if you have any current pets. Do include your contact details in your enquiry. ENQUIRIES WITHOUT ANY INFORMATION ABOUT YOURSELF WILL NOT BE ENTERTAINED. *There is a mandatory adoption fee. The money will be donated to PAWs or Metta Cats to help other cats and dogs in need. Some information about the breed: Scottish Folds are not lap cats. They will only come sit close to you or on you when they feel like it. They do however, like laying on their backs to have their belly rubbed. Short-haired Scottish Folds are relatively low maintenance. These cats usually have a bath once a month, and brushed every now and again. (They don't really need to be brushed, but they like it.. so we do it.) Note: The cream coloured SF has a double-fold.. so there are more cartilage in her ears. This means her ears will need regular cleaning. Preferably on a daily basis. If not, 3 times a week would suffice too. The grey cat is more low maintenance. We clean her ears once a month. She's got a single fold, and her ears have lifted.. so there's isn't much of a fold left. We hope that these cats will go to a good permanent home. We're very sad about giving them up. So do not write to us if you intend to adopt just because they are pure breds, they're cute or because your child wants one. Breeding is out of the question as they have been sterilised. These cats will be extremely shy during the transition phase of going to a new home. The new family must have patience with them. Like adopting a real child.. don't expect a cuddle from them or getting them to come to you for a stroke immediately when you take them home. They need time to adjust to a new environment.. which will take 1 to 4 weeks or even longer.. (It depends on how they come to trust you)"

I'll be moving overseas so I would like to look for a new home for her. Preferably a place where she can have access to the outdoors. She's an outdoorsy cat. She's very curious and confident. Has no fear of anything and very playful and active. She's a tomboy so she has no dainty manners. She can probably get along well with dogs and active cats but if you have an existing cat who is gentle, jumpy and scared of stuff I wouldn't recommend her. Ginger will cause your gentle cat a lot of distress. She is about 6 years old. She's blind in one eye because she fell off my balcony as a kitten but it doesn't impair her in any way. She loves people but doesn't really like cuddles. She'll only rub against your legs when she wants food. She is litter trained. Hates pine litter though. She enjoys running around at full speed and enjoys being chased. She eats raw chicken and regular cat kibble. She's well mannered when it comes to human food.

Dog,Golden Retriever,Female,Golden,Large,Long,No,No,No,Healthy,1,0,"We took in Marley from a sick gentleman who was unable to care for this puppy. Initially we had someone who adopted her but, soon discovered that the owner is not a suitable candidate to have her. As guardians to this puppy, my husband and i felt that Marley needs a better environment and family. We have a 4-year-old Golden Retriever of our own that we rescued 2 years ago. We follow and practice the techniques of Cesar Millan and we are looking for suitable owners who are familiar with dogs to adopt Marley. Bob Marley is a 6 months old puppy; very playful, intelligent, alert and is a good watch dog. She likes to jog along with the handler. After awhile of getting to know you, you can walk or jog with her without a leash. As an advice, do bring along a leash anyhow. Golden Retriever puppies are hyper but will mellow down as it gets older from age 1 to 2 onward. Still, all dogs have their unique personality which you will come to know in time. This breed needs a cool environment due to its coat. They do well with owners who have big compound and lots of shades. For owners who prefer their dogs living indoor with them, this breed is also suitable for it, provided she can go out 2 to 3 times a day to do her business on grassy land. If you are unsure of this breed, do Google and study about this breed. We love this dog and we sincerely hope to find the best owner for her. Grooming is moderate."

I already keep her for almost a month, but again, I can’t keep her forever because no matter how I wanted to my family in Indonesia wouldn’t allow me to bring her back, and now while I’m staying here with others housemate, they don’t like dog. There's no choice but to give her up for a good lovely home. The adopter would have everything that she has now, the cage, food, and toys will be given.

We took her in and nursed her, but she was always limping on her right hind leg. From x-ray findings she has a fractured femoral head. She is too young for surgery, but with rest it would heal. She should not jump and run for 2 months. Nondi remains to be a very active kitten, very independant. She is litter tray trained. We are looking for someone to adopt her as we have too many cats. We prefer to give her up to a working Malaysian, no students. We are looking for someone who will vaccinate and neuter her and also take her for regular vet checks. She needs to be kept indoors. For her condition now she should be caged, BUT she hates the cage. So right now she stays in a room but is caged at night. This is only coz we want the fracture to heal. She is very good with our cats and dogs, but mostly she is on her own. Keeping a cat is a commitment for about 15 years and they are children that never grow up and it isn't cheap to keep a pet.

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Golden,Small,Short,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,1,100,"Mr Stripey (his temporary foster name) was rescued as part of a 3-kitten all-male litter together with their mother from a backlane opposite my home in early October . and after ensuring that they are in good health and well-socialised after almost 2 months of fostering them, the kittens are now ready to be rehomed. - They are applied with Revolution monthly to protect against fleas, ear mites, heartworms & intestinal worms (dewormed). - Mr Stripey's weight has bloomed from 1.7kg on 11 October to 2.3kg as at 15 November . - They are fed with Evo premium dry kitten kibbles. - I'm feeding them with vet-approved Vetri-DMG liquid supplement to boost their growing development. - They drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled daily to condition the kittens to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage their health and shorten their life. - They're toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Catit premium litter. - Their poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as their overall health. - I regularly clean their eyes and noses with saline solution and their ears with Ilium Oticlean. I also trim their nails. Their fur is short but silky clean since they are not allowed outdoors. - Mr Stripey has been vaccinated on 18 October (4-in-1, RM50) with a booster vaccination on 15 November (4-in-1, RM50) at a total cost of RM. - Mr Stripey's behaviour is outgoing and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for his future when you return to your home country. 2) He must be kept indoors at all times. 3) You should have a cat cage to confine him for the first few weeks to let him feel secure and get used to your home surroundings. 4) Neuter him when he's old enough at 8 months old. 5) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 6) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 7) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover his vaccination cost. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If Mr Stripey is adopted with his sibling, Mr Fiesty ( ), there would be a 50% reduction on the second adoption fee. 8) It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Mr Stripey. 9) Please adopt on a weekend as I'm working full-time on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Mr Stripey, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. Looking forward to hearing from you! :)"

Cat,Burmilla,Female,Brown,Large,Medium,Yes,None,No,Healthy,1,0,"We are giving Maya away since we couldn't take care of her anymore. Maya is very docile, loving and smart so you don't have to worry when she's with little kids. If you treat her right she will love you to the max she loves to climb on you and give you kisses and smell your scent. She can also be a little rebel if you're no good with her. She's old therefore it's very important that she gets love, good care and attention from her new owner. It would be good if you can keep her in the house or in the house compound instead of in the cage because she's not the kind of cat you keep inside a cage, she'd get depressed and become rebellious. If you love cats who are calm and gentle then you should definitely adopt Maya. Not only she's beautiful but she has a mind of her own too, which makes her very special. If you'd like to adopt her please contact us. Note that most of these pictures below are not recent, Maya is skinnier now but she still looks the same anyway. Self pick up only. Maya is litter trained, and sorry she's not 4 years old, probably 5 - 7 years old we aren't sure because we adopted her from SPCA years ago. I will update this profile soon to show you latest photos of her. Thank you. Maya's Owner(s)"

[names are all temporary, for convenience] Curly [Male Ginger] Has a curly tail, cute white toe socks and a playful and curious personality. Sort of the 'Big Brother' of the litter, a little bigger than the rest and a outgoing personality to match! Chinaman [Male Ginger] Has unique eyes, and a comparably calmer demeanor compared to Curly, Tiger and Tortoiseshell, but still plays very well with all siblings at playtime 3. Trinity [Female tricolour of white, orange, black] Very playful and energetic, she is the one to initiate play all the time and runs around the most compared to her sibs. Also very fastidious in her cleaning, as I see her clean herself longer than the others do. She has a soft, very prettily coloured coat and white stockings Big Eyes [Female gray tabby] She has a comparatively gentler temperament, and is more on the reserved side like Chinaman, and both like to sit and stare quietly at times, but when it's playtime she runs about with the rest. She has softer fur than the others, and may turn out to have medium rather than short length fur. Tiger [Female gray-brown tabby] The runt of the litter, she is lively, energetic and can be very vocal to compensate for her small size. She keeps up just fine with everyone, and has a rather unique shade of coating, a gray orange hue. Please message for any inquiries, more pictures or videos, I would be very happy to oblige, cheers!"

A spacious compound to run around in would be great for a strapping young lad like me. I'd love to be taken for daily walks - experienced owner who can handle 40kg of excited dog would be ideal!

Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Adoption fee of RM to cover neutering cost and partially cover the cost fosterer has spent on Maxi's care. 4. Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 5.

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Golden,Small,Short,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,1,65,"20 September update: Roma has been adopted by Li of Kajang! Thank you! : D Roma was rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . After a month of fostering him to ensure that he is in good health and well socialised, he is now ready to be rehomed. - He was dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM9) & 12 September (RM6) at a total cost of RM15. - He has been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding him with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - I regularly trimmed his nails, cleaned his face with a saline solution and ears with Ilium Oticlean solution. - His weight is 0.55 kg as at 12 September . - He's eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - He drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kitten to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage his health and shorten his life. - He's toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - His poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as his overall health. - He has been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM50. - His behaviour is perfect as a pet as he's completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. He's friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept him too) as he's well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Roma's future when you return to your home country. 2) Roma must be kept indoors at all times. 3) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 4) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 5) The RM65 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Roma. If possible, adopt Roma at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Roma, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. Looking forward to hearing from you! :)"

Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and kitty are suitable for each other. - Then you can meet your chosen pet at the rescuer's home. - If the meeting goes well your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and spaying to be borne by adopter.

Dog,Mixed Breed,Female,Brown,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,1,0,"Update: Just to clear the doubts, Milo is a MIXED breed. I believe that she was born by a mother of jack russell breed but I can't confirm. Many called in to ask if she is a PURE breed, but sad to say that she is what she is. Whether a pure breed or not, it is still going to be a very good companion dog anyway. She is going thru house training where it is trained to pee/poo on a same spot (old news paper) and not to bite anything that comes into her way (a dog's nature). She is very playful and human friendly. She will definitely loves you with everything she has got if you treat her with love. This one I can guarantee! She is suitable to be kept as a house pet rather than a guard dog (tied up just to guard the house). I believe every single animal on earth deserves to live with freedom, no body likes to be locked up. Those who respect life, loves dog and able to provide love instead of just food and shelter are welcome to adopt Milo. Thanks :) -------------------------------------------------- Rescued from somewhere near my house at Balakong. Found a total of 6 of them yesterday when I drove pass the area. 4 of them felt into a drain and were soaking wet. Me and my wife quickly take them out and found that they were abandoned by a irresponsible owner. They all inherited this jack russell's look leading me to think that they are all from a jack russell mother. Both of them with brown patches around their heads and fully white body. 4 of them were adopted by my neighbours and now left with 2. They are urgently in need of a home as we are only able to foster them until July as we will be away for few weeks for an oversea trip. Besides that, we have got 4 dogs already at home, could not afford to keep another 2 in. I hope some of you dog lovers out there can provide a home for these 2 lovely puppies. They are very healthy and ready to be rehomed. We bought them for first vaccination today and from the guess of the vet, they should be around 1-2 months old. Perfect for someone who is looking for a young puppy where you can start to build the relationship and bonding with them. They are both very active and playful. You may refer to the attached videos :). Thank you very much!"

At night, I'm a good watch dog. I eat regular dog kibbles and treats, sometimes my daddy gives me chicken which is my favourite. Email my daddy soon and he'll make arrangements for you to meet me."

Dog,Mixed Breed,Female,Black,Medium,Short,No,No,No,Healthy,1,0,"Cookie was adopted by a loving caring mother of 2, Sue Ann. I was touched by the genuine heart that Sue Ann had, she bought collar, treats, leash for Cookie. Although she is a new dog owner but she had sought advice from friends and research on her own. I am thankful to God for such a loving person like Sue Ann. This is a puppy I rescued in Seremban 2. She is really smart, though has not attended any dog training courses, she can sit still, stay still for quite a long while. There is a video clip of her stay still up to 1 minute. My fosterer has two other dogs, one is a schnauzer and another one is a mixed breed stray dog. Cookie can learn even faster than the schnauzer. When my fosterer put her in front of main door, she only barks at any stranger that passed by where the schnauzer does not care. Please feel free to come and visit her so you can know her better. *If you email me, please leave down your contact number. Thanks."

I couldn't leave them there knowing what would eventually happen to them....so I brought them home. The state of our country is such that most shelters are barely surviving with minimal funds. Therefore I am trying to find them loving homes on my own. I would love to keep them myself but I already have four dogs. My neighbours are not very happy and asking me to 'buang' as if they are some unwanted rubbish( apparently they are not as compassionate as I would like them to be). I have checked with the local authority and I was told that there can only be four dogs per household and I may keep more if the neighbours don't complain but if they do they will remove all the dogs and put them to sleep (may not be the case, perhaps they were just trying to scare me).I now run the risk of losing all my dogs but I still believe I can find these puppies loving home with your help. Please help me give these puppies a chance at life...All you have to do is to help me find them a home. May God Bless your act of kindness."

Otherwise we'll have to take him to Paws :( ----- Story: We found an orange tabby kitten in Damansara Utama. He was hiding from another mother cat who was being very aggressive because she was near her kittens. We think he might be looking for his mother and just went near this cat, hoping for someone to take care or sayang him. He was shivering, limping slightly and had an ear pierced with a metal wire that was already turning rusty. So kesian.. We took him to the vet, who removed the piercing because it was hurting him. Good news, only minor injuries which are now healing nicely. We also dewormed and de-flea him. He was wearing a pink tag with the name ""NUR MAISARAH"" written on it. We are looking for his owner, or someone to adopt him. Please contact us by 13 May or we'll have to send him to Paws :( Thank you!"

Cat,Domestic Medium Hair,Mixed,Black,Medium,Medium,No,No,No,Healthy,3,0,"About 3+ weeks ago a cat walked up 4 flights of stairs to my apartment and decided to have 3 kittens behind and under my TV table. Being a cat and all animal lover I thought poor thing, it must have been frightened or felt uncomfortable where she “lived” so decided to come have her kittens in my place. I also assumed she belonged to one of my many neighbours who apparently are “cat lovers or owners”….. the ones who let their cats run about and poo all over the condo area stinking up the area. Anyway I have provided mother and kittens with a safe and clean place to stay. The mother comes and goes, presumably to her owner or to look for food and do her business. Assuming she “belongs” to one of my neighbours I have put up signs on all blocks with pictures attached for the owner to come collect their bundle of fun, also saying “if you don’t I will have offer them up for adoption and/or send them all to SPCA. To date I have not had any replies to my posters. Lately the mother cat does not come back as often as she should and I’m doing my best to “feed” them. I never planned to keep them but just give them temporary shelter till someone claims them or the mother sorts herself out and returns to her own accommodation/owner or starts paying rent :-) Now I offer them to any cat lover/owners. Next step will be to SPCA or any other animal shelter. Attached are some pictures of these adorable kittens.

In actual fact, once the female dogs are spayed, they will not have period any more.(The spaying cost is not expensive if you go for government vet). Moreover, my experience is female dogs are easier to be trained for toileting. The conditions for adoption are: 1. Deworm and vaccinate it immediately after you adopt it. 2.

The vet says that he was quite small for his age, and not healthy enough to get vaccinated. Ultrasound scans show that his intestines have very thick lining, explaining why he was small (malabsorption) and had loose stool (maldigestion). After a few rounds of medication and gastro-intestinal kibbles, he's much better now. His coat is smooth and shinny. He has good appetite and his poop is normal now. He's been de-flea, dewormed, vaccinated (1st dose only), and castrated. He's tested negative for FIV and FeLV. Gus has short-medium coat. He has a particularly long and fluffy tail. The vet says that there might be some Maine Coon background as Gus has an oblong build. He's a loving cat with good temperament. He loves to sleep on my hand/arm while I work on the computer. He recognize people and can be wary of strangers. But warms up to people after some playtime together. He spends his days eating, sleeping and playing in my office.

For how long and is the dog still with you? 3)Are there other dog(s) in your house? How many and what are their gender? 4)Are there other family member(s) and who would be the main care taker? 5)Puppies need to be toilet trained.

He's a very feisty puppy and within 1 day warmed up to being around people.

I would really want to find him a home as soon as possible and it would break my heart if I ultimately would have to leave him in a shelter home :(

He's healthy and is on antibiotics for treatment of ticks for the next ten days before going for vaccination. Aside from slight anemia and being quite timid at this point (but who can blame him!) he is very easy to take care of. At two months he's already starting to come into a big personality - he's very playful and loves being cuddled. We found him on 31st Oct. and on the 1st of November, he pretty much learned how to obey the command ""No"". Smart little guy!!! Sadly we already have two rescued dogs... and both of them are feeling very depressed at the moment because they feel threatened that this little bundle of joy will replace them. It wouldn't be fair on them to keep little Steve so I am hoping that we can find him a really loving family who will shower him with only the best attention and love.

We sent to vet clinic immediately and found that she suffered from deficiency of blood calcium after giving birth. Immediate treatment was given and her condition been stabilized today but she's still very weak. We went back to her colony and found 6 of her babies hiding under a car. Moomoo're not allowed to feed her babies anymore if not she will lack of calcium again. We took all 6 babies home and taking care of the mom and babies in different places now. We really need to find all the babies a forever home filled with love and care urgently. Please, ADOPT instead of buying. A home means a lot to them. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - No tying/caging for long period - On leash when bring dog out - Keep dog indoor all the time - Agree to bring pet for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat them like your own precious family members Please give a home to Moomoo's babies ♥"

Cat,Domestic Medium Hair,Male,Golden,Medium,Medium,No,No,No,Healthy,1,0,"Found this cute tabby at my front porch. He obviously belonged to somebody (he was dying to get into my house :) but his irresponsible owners left him at my house, perhaps hoping I would adopt him since I already have so many cats. But the problem is I cant since I already have so many cats! He has soulful orange eyes (yes orange, not yellow :) (uncommon for a ginger tabby) and a beautiful light golden orange striped coat. His fur is medium length and quite fluffy. He also has a very long and elegant tail. Personality wise he is a sweetheart. Very affectionate (manja), no matter how I shoo him away he keeps on coming begging to be given attention :) and he is also obedient, he listened when I said he can't come into the house. Therefore, despite being so manja he is also very independent. I'm looking for someone to give him a loving forever home that he obviously so desperately craves for. Pls email me if you are interested. I'm sure you wont regret it. PS: I prefer owners who would neuter him. Cant bear to know he will get into terrible fights or will just go missing from roaming around looking for females when he reach maturity."

Dog,Mixed Breed,Female,Brown,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,1,0,"This here is Molek! (story background) We found her, her siblings (all 6 of them) and her mummy under an abandoned car in front of a 99 speed mart in Bandar Sunway. Our family came over daily to feed the mummy dog as our initial plan was to wait till all of them are old enough to eat kibbles and put them up for adoption and neuter the mummy dog. However, very very unfortunately, 2 of her siblings fell into a longkang and drowned while one probably wondered abit too far out and got run over by a car. We knew then that we needed to step in and help them! So we took them in. So far, we have managed to get 5 of them adopted and they are so loved and happy! We hope for a happy ending for Molek too! (if you are wondering why we don't just take her in as our own, its cause we already have a lot of dogs, we started out as fosters but ended up adopting many of our foster dogs and now we really cannot take in anymore and it would be unfair for them because we can't give them the attention and affection that they truly deserve!) Sorry for the long winded story, so here is Molek, waiting for a furrrever home. She's extremely bright! Playful, active, sweet and loving! She mixes well with other dogs (benefits of being around other foster dogs)! She's a great guard dog too! And a major plus point is she's up to date with all her vaccines and she is neuter (save u the trouble)! We're located in klang valley pj area, very close to Sunway Pyramid! Do not hesitate to contact me if you are interested. The best way to get me would be via telephone! Thank you for viewing ^_^"

Dog,Pomeranian,Male,Brown,Small,Medium,None,None,None,Healthy,1,0,"Found this lost Pomeranian in my neighborhood. He is a male and around 4 to 5-year-old. Can't take in another dog as I already have a Shih Tzu of my own. Will put him up for adoption if cannot find his owner in 7 days. If anyone is interested to adopt him please send me an e-mail. This dog is well taken care of by his previous owner, nails are trimmed, no ticks nor fleas and he doesn't bark much. He is potty-trained too. He pees and poos outside the house. UPDATE (17 June, ): Re-captured Bravo in the neighbourhood. He looked tired and weary. This doggie has a habit of escaping by jumping through the high gate and window after getting warm shower, food, and shelter (for a night or two) from the rescuer. He has made ""Running Away"" his lifetime profession and it really broke our hearts. Thus, we have no choice but to put him up for adoption. We do not believe in caging or putting a leash on the dogs. In Bravo's case, it is different. If we are not careful, he'll escape once again (he's a good jumper). Today we brought him to the nearby vet to check if he has a microchip embedded in his body. But the scanner couldn't locate any. Therefore any attempt to find the original owner is futile. (In addition, I believe its master also gave up long time ago on a runaway delinquent like Bravo.) So if you are STILL interested to adopt Bravo, please contact me. Breeders’ requests will not be entertained. We’ll scan through all the prospective candidates to find Bravo a good home. UPDATE (18 June, ): Due to overwhelming responses and my phone number becoming a hotline, I have decided to post up my questions (here) for those who are interested to adopt Bravo. Please e-mail your reply to me. Do NOT post your answers in the comments section. 1) Name: 2) Phone: 3) E-mail: 4) Age: 5) Profession: 6) Do you live in your own property? (Yes/No) 7) Do you stay in a house/flat/apartment/condo? 8) Will there be someone at home when you are away for work or school? 9) Do you have a pet of your own? (Pet's details - Name, age, dog/cat, spayed, etc.) 10) Do you cage your pets? Why? 11) If your pet doesn't want to eat its food, what will you do? 12) How are you going to manage or take care of a dog which makes ""Running Away"" its lifetime profession?"

Dog,Golden Retriever,Female,Black,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,1,50,"Tinka has been with our family since she was a puppy. Now we are moving abroad and out of our three dogs we can only take one with us. Therefore we are looking for a loving home for her. With her shiny black coat she looks quite impressive, but she is a gentle creature when it comes to people. We have always felt very safe with her around. Tinka has attended dog trainings and knows the basic commands. She loves to learn new things and show her skills, and if she gets a praise for it - even better! although she makes an excellent guard dog she spends a great deal of the day being lazy and just being happy to be around someone. Her ideal family takes her out on walks and makes her part of the family (one of her happy days was when she ""convinced"" me that she was allowed to watch TV on the couch with me). In return she will be very loyal and watch out for her family. She doesn't like cats and needs some time to get used to other dogs. She was fine with our other two dogs, and I never had a problem taking her to the vet or leaving her at the kennel when we went away, but there are a few dogs in our neighborhood that she does not approve of. We currently allow her to be inside the house as well as in the garden, so please don't keep her in a small cage or on a chain all day long. Staying alone during the day has never been a problem We really hope that there is someone out there who will take her in (maybe even together with Rosie) and give her the life she deserves"

It was malnourished and had a virus so bad that I initially thought it was abused. We offered it food and water but it was too weak to accept it. We knew that it would most likely die of hunger with the state it was in, so we brought it to the veterinary clinic. Since then we have nursed it back to health and brought it back to KL with us. What I have noticed that it is like no other streetcat I've seen before - friendly, cuddly, curious, supercool, overall a lovely character. You may have heard it all before but he is quite a special one! He is now fully recovered from his wounds. We have also dewormed and defleaed him, and his fur is purrfectly beautiful. We are now progressing him with the best vaccination possible.

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Black,Medium,Short,No,Yes,No,Healthy,1,0,"Swagger is a bright, confident little kitten looking for a loving active family to take him to their hearts. He was picked up at a local mamak restaurant, where he had been dumped by a family. When I took him in, Swagger was skinny, dull and just wanted to sleep all the time, but with lots of food and lots of love he has blossomed into a playful affectionate kitten! Swagger loves his tin-foil ball, his mouse toy and a little bit of gentle wrestling. He also really loves his food and bowl of milk. A curious and adventurous animal, he loves exploring the world around him, but in the evening when he's exhausted he also likes to sleep on laps. When he gets excited, his beautiful long tail fluffs up like a mini Christmas tree. He likes to be scratched under the chin, and especially loves to have someone rub his white furry tummy. A great purrer, Swagger is also an accomplished kisser of noses. Swagger is toilet trained, clean, a good eater and a pleasant, well-mannered kitten, suitable for children and adults. Update May : Dear little Swagger got adopted on Mother's Day and was taken away to his forever home. Good luck, happy kitten!"

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Gray,Medium,Short,Yes,No,No,Healthy,1,0,"I almost knocked down this kitten yesterday afternoon while driving a car (22-Nov-). I took it and brought this cute kitten to a nearby animal clinic to be examined right away. The doctor confirmed it was a male kitten, between the ages of two months, and after examination, the doctor confirmed it was in healthy condition. Cat flea medication was given. In good faith, our family is unable to care for this kitten because it was too small, moreover, my wife and I work on long day, while the children are in college. This kitten needs someone who can give greater attention to him. And we already have a big male cat and a rabbit. We fear we can not provide love and care to this kitten. By the way I name him ""TWENITU"", because I met him on the / :-) So, I appeal to anyone who is willing to take care of TWENITU to contact me. In the meantime, I will make sure it is in good health and the doctor advised me to bring it back to the clinic after a week for the vaccine etc. Thank you."

Mei Xin jie jie is a very sweet girl and she will be playing with me when I get to my new home.I love her too! That's why mummy decided to let me live with them. _______________________________________________ Faith was a little tiny puppy when I found her wandering around.She had a bald tip tail and hind legs and could not walk properly thus we believed she was ill-treated from home and had no proper nutrition. So we brought her home and sent her to the vet. The vet said she was about 1 month plus old then. She was given medicine and dewormed but not heart guard as she was too tiny. She's now healed with LOTS OF HAIR!! and very healthy. We are a couple staying in a rented home with neighbours who complain about our dogs let free in the compound.Therefore Faith lives in a cage whenever we're off to work and out of home. I am now not working but will soon be working again. Also, due to our financial status, we're not able to to provide proper nutrition to all the animals thus we have decided to let go Faith the youngest dog which needs the nutrition and a proper growing envinroment most. Faith is toilet trained and she's fleas/ticks/mites free.

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Female,Black,Medium,Short,No,No,No,Healthy,1,0,"Profile Ringkas: Name: Mama Kin Age: Adult cat.Probably 1 year and half. Condition: Healthy and Pregnant (Probably will deliver in early May). Believed that this is not the first time she is pregnant. Characteristics: Adorable. Soft. Very affectionate dan sangat manja. Likes to purr a lot. Likes to roll her self on the floor:) Sangat comel bila dia golek-golekkan badan dia atas lantai;) Likes to clean herself frequently. Even with a bulging stomach, she is still a playful mama and like to play:) Why she needs to be adopted asap: Cause the Cat Catcher of my hostel block has started their cat cat catching operation and they may take Mama Kin away to unknown-unsafe place..worse, according to the Cat Catcher,the cats that they have captured will be taken to the zoo negara. Mama Kin's story: Mama Kin is a stray cat that came to my hostel block about two months ago, out of nowhere, right after Mega and her kids have left us. When we started to approach Mama Kin, we noticed that she is an adult cat and she is also pregnant. Without any bias or judgment, yet with with warm hearts, we welcome her to our lives and to this hostel block. Kami namakan dia Mama Kin sebab kaki dia ada 'white spots' that make her looks as if dia pakai stokin;) She is a pretty, adorable and cute pregnant mummy cat. She has been a very good and affectionate cat too. Dia sangat manja. She likes to purr a lot every time I play with her, caress her head, stroke her fur and give her some food. Despite the fact that we love having her around, we know that ""some people"" don't like it. Dan ""some people"" yang dimaksudkan di sini ialah ""the hostel management people"". Just like other cases of cats in this hostel block, we do fear that Mama Kin will be taken away by the Cat Catcher assigned by the hostel management sooner or later. Kalau kucing-kucing ini diambil dan dibawa ke tempat seperti SPCA ke, saya tak kisah. But the Cat Catcher once told me that the cats that he has captured will be brought to zoo negara or somewhere unknown. I totally don't want these cats to be taken to zoo negara or anywhere else that's not safe. Therefore, me and my friends realize that one day we need to find Mama Kin a new owner and release her from this ""cat hater"" place. So, we at first plan to give her away for adoption after she has given birth. Unfortunately, the day that we fear has come. This morning, the Cat Catcher came to my hostel and he and the team searched high and low for any cats, just any cats whether it's the one that has been neutered or not. However, thank God, Alhamdulillah and I'm so grateful that some of my friends who are also cat lovers managed to act quickly and managed to save and hide other cats in some rooms and Mama Kin is now hiding in my room. And this is not the end. They will come again soon cause they know, the cats that they are searching for are not captured today. With all this panic moment and in such dangerous state, I think I can't wait until Mama Kin has delivered. I can't wait after her delivery. It's going to take longer time and her life is 'at stake' now, if I may put it that way. So, I'm putting up Mama Kin's profile in here, so that anybody who's a true cat lover, kind-hearted, considerate and caring out there could have the heart to adopt her. Please... Yes, she is pregnant. And the person who would love to adopt her must be the one who is prepared and ready for new comers. If that person doesn't plan to have them all, perhaps you could be patient for awhile and later, you could give them away for adoption once the kittens are big enough. I'm searching for someone who really really appreciates cats whether they are adults or kittens. Why I say this is because, when I 'advertise' Mega and her kitten not long ago,I found out some people like to have the kittens yet abandon the mother. There was this one couple who intended to adopt Mega and one of her kittens. Tapi this couple told me that they live in an apartment. So what they plan to do is to keep the kitten but put Mega downstairs with other stray cats. Kalau macam tu, apa guna saya iklankan untuk Mega di'adopt'. Baik saya 'buang' saja Mega ke zoo negara seperti yang dilakukan oleh Cat Catcher di hostel block saya ni. So, basically, all I'm asking and hoping for is to have a cat lover who is responsible and caring to take good care of the pregnant and adorable Mama Kin which deserves to feel loved and be happy in a safer place, as soon as possible. That's all. Please... Thank you=)"

Dog,Poodle,Female,Cream,Small,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,1,0,"ADOPTION FEE IS AN OPTIONAL CONTRIBUTION TO OUR RESCUE EFFORT. Pearly was surrendered to us by a family who admitted to neglecting her. They often caged her and chained her up, rarely taking her out for walks and providing her with little stimulation. As a result, Pearly needed mental rehabilitation when she came to us. After only a month, Pearly is much more stable and better socialised. She has learned to play with other dogs but does not mix well with dogs (or humans) that are hyperactive or overly excitable. She is timid with strangers but becomes attached to people easily, soon following them all around the house. Pearly must be kept primarily indoors even though she loves daily walks."

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Male,White,Medium,Short,No,Yes,No,Healthy,1,0,"Hi everyone! My name is Pinky and i'm about 3 weeks old now. My foster mummy Lyn found me all alone in the driveway of a vacant house on jalan sri hartamas 2 on saturday september 12 after receiving a phonecall about an abandoned kitten. I was curled up in a tight ball and didn't move when she touched me and spoke to me. I was covered in filth and looked dead. The lady that called her about me told her that my siblings and cat mummy used to all live in that empty house together but then my mummy moved away and took my siblings with her.. i think she forgot about me. the people in the house next door watched and waited for her to come back but she didnt.. that's when they called for help because they knew i was dying. I have been with my foster mummy for almost 2 weeks now and i'm feeling much better though i haven't grown much. I'm still too thin and i don't like the kitten milk formula very much. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 to 4 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. Preferably INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT please unless during instances of illness or injury. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Pinky. - See if potential adopter and Pinky are suitable for each other. I will ask some questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Pinky vaccinated before being able to take Pinky home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I might occasionally ask adopter for updates to see how Pinky is doing. Interested parties can sms, or email me. Serious enquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated. UPDATE: Pinky started eating Hill's prescription diet A/D yesterday (/09)through a syringe. He used the litter box for the first time by himself on /09. We're so pleased!"

He knows handshake and when I scolded him once, he knows it and will be more alert of his action when he sees my body language. He is a good guard dog even at this young age. He will bark when he saw something strange and went forward to check it out. He is not good with cats WHEN there is food. And er.. not good w dogs too when he is eating. Just imagine this lil pup protecting his food against other dogs 10times his size! And the other big dogs seems to obey him! He is one leader. Either that or a gangster :D"

Dog,Mixed Breed,Female,Black,Medium,Short,No,Yes,No,Healthy,1,200,"Adoption fee includes the basic medical expenses of the animal : 3 vaccinations + spaying surgery fees. Yesterday night we met Bambi. She ran out from the roadside very quickly to the middle of the road and our car nearly hit her. She's a super beautiful tiger striped girl with innocent big round eyes. Bambi is very intelligent also. She knows to pee and poo most of the time on rag and newspaper without training. But she's a very manja girl and love to stick with human, when she can't see any people around her she will feel insecure and cry. But when you're with her, she will just be very quiet and sit or sleep beside you. A very sweet little baby! Adopter need to be patient with her at the beginning as she's still a little baby now, she can be trained to be independent after a period. We feel that Bambi is more suitable to keep indoor at this point since she don't pee and poo anywhere and loves to have companion... Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - No tying/caging for long period - On leash when bring her out - Keep her indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat her like your own precious family members Please give a home to Bambi ♥"

Loves outdoor & need time bring for walk once/twice a day (love running). He pull on leash as it natural for husky. Can be train because I tried before and still need more training. Skin sensitive(itching) still need care or treatment. Husky a large breed dog need a little of space. Husky is not as easy as you think. He don't obey anything you ask. If you loyal to it , he'll sure listen to you. Because he obey my parents than me. He good with kids too. Please take note, as mention he have maggot wound which is at his private part/ball. That wound is fully healed but recently we just found out there's red spot spotted under it ball which is diff area than his previous wound. Doctor doubt that in his last treatment didn't clean his wound properly which caused a chance that there might be another maggot. It can be cure by taking oral medication as his previous maggot wound healed after few weeks time. Its a shame that owner abandon this beautiful dog and I couldn't handle 2 dogs because I have Jack Russell & small space plus my old man don't really like big dog. Can only keep him until end of this month. Hope it can find the right owner soon as I not able to keep him for long. I don't want it end up in SPCA. I have tried my best and did what I had to do for helping this husky. Hope either of you who's good hearted can take care & love him forever. Please do not adopt if you are looking for PEDIGREE as this dog here need forever loving home. And for the dog medical fee purpose a minimum fee as stated above will be charge for adoption. Serious adopter can contact me and for the adoption fee can be nego too. Interest kindly contact me for more info.. You can come over to meet him first. Area Klang / Setia Alam / 1U dog park.

She can likely be taught to be a lap-kitten, enjoys strokes and being baby-talked. She is the best climber and learns things real quick! Loves toys (especially feathered ones) and adventure - she also has an odd-obsession with watching us cleaning out the litter box (and sometimes getting in there to ""help"" us). ♥ She's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Coco must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - She's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Spaying is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement.

Dog,Mixed Breed,Male,Brown,Small,Short,No,No,No,Healthy,1,0,"On / i have rescued a small puppy approximately 2 months old male mongrel, a car was about to hit him when the puppy was trying to go across the road. Luckily for the puppy he managed to dodge the in coming car just in time. The puppy was so shaken and i decided to bring him home for temporary care, he was so hungry that he finish up all the food in just seconds and of course after the meal it was time to take a good and nice hot bath. I was unable to care for this puppy for long time as i'm staying at a apartment and i have a 9 months old female mongrel dog with me, which i rescue her 6 months ago when her owner decided to leave her alone by the road side. To my surprise my female dog seems to enjoy the male puppy company, well maybe they share the same fate as a mongrel and stray around by the roadside and so my female dog decided to treat the small male puppy nice. The puppy was a very active dog, he likes to follow me around where ever i go and when i keep him in a cage or when he does not see me around for a short period of time he whine and whine until he fall asleep. Anyway i sincerely hope that someone can adopt the male puppy and give him a nice warm home.. . anyone who is interested,sincere and serious to give the puppy a new home can contact me anytime, please find below my detail.thank you"

My pets & compounds are clean, well behaved and licenced, but some ppl are just plain nasty. Miji is very manja and a small eater. She can understand commands like sit, hand, get in the cage, wait, kiss, hug and carry. She is also very alert, thus makes a good guard. I thought since she's spayed and vaccinated, she'll stand a better chance to be adopted as the new owner won't need to pay more than her annual jabs. But if someone rather take the 4 months old puppy, pls call too. I wish I can rescue all 3 of them, but I will be breaking the rules.

Dog,Irish Wolfhound,Female,Black,Medium,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,1,0,"Introducing Kayla! _________________________________________________ Details: ♥ Female, 10 months old, Irish Wolfhound + Border Collie mix. She has a rough medium length coat (black and white). ♥ Kayla is under foster care as her family had to travel overseas due to unforeseen circumstances. Kayla is now seeking a permanent new family. _________________________________________________ Character: ♥ Kayla is an intelligent and high energy dog. She loves taking walks (especially running around fields, beaches, hiking, etc). If you're an active person, she will happily tag along on a leash as you do your daily runs/cycling/etc. :) ♥ DESPITE her energy; Kayla is a VERY calm dog when indoors! She will only get onto beds/sofas if invited and otherwise makes herself comfy where she can. ♥ Kayla understands a few commands like ""sit"", ""stay"" and ""shake"". She was also trained to wait for her food and walk off leash by her previous owners (however I have not followed up on this during the period of foster care). ♥ She has an amazing temperament too! Gets along well with dogs (cats also if she sees them indoors/as part of the family. Kayla is especially patient and loving around children, She's the type of dog that would lie in bed with the kids and keep them feeling safe/protected. ♥ Kayla requires NO grooming whatsoever as her fur stays the length it already is. She also hardly ""smells"" and only needs a bath once a month at most if indoors (unless she's really had a muddy run somewhere or rolled where she shouldn't). ♥ Kayla loves water too! She will half-sit in a pool, even chase after water sprinkling out of a hose. :) ♥ Potty habits; When indoors, Kayla will bark 3 - 4 times in a row to let her people know she needs to be let out to do her business. She appreciates routine daily walks (at least once in the morning, another in the evening before bedtime). ♥ Kayla is fully vaccinated (rabies shots included). She is also spayed, parasite free and micro-chipped. She is not fussy about food either. _________________________________________________ *** PLEASE READ (Note for potential adopters) *** ♥ Kayla takes time to adjust to new people (at least 2 weeks to trust). She will bond closely to anyone who pays the most attention to her. She will accept ""firm"" tones when being trained but NO rough tones/scolding of any kind. ♥ Kayla likes being indoors % EXCEPT when she needs to be taken out for some form of activity. Adopters practicing this are preferred. ♥ Kayla needs round the clock attention (she will get anxious if left crated any longer than 4 hours a day). Adopters with lots of time on their hands are her best preference. ♥ An adoption fee will apply to cover Kayla's basic care (please inquire). Her cards will be passed to successful adopters. :) _________________________________________________ Please drop me a call or email if interested in taking this girl home. Details on your past experience with dogs will be much appreciated. Thank you!"

Cat,Domestic Medium Hair,Female,Black,Medium,Medium,No,No,No,Healthy,1,0,"You can contact me through whatsapp/line to know about the cat. Conditions For Adopting : 1. No first time adopters without experience. Friendly first Time adopters with experience are welcome. 2. Keep in contact.Please send me picture of her every now and then.I want to be assured that she's fine and growing well. 3. Be absolutely sure that you will commit to her before adopting. 4. I will try to converse with you a bit before giving her because I want to know the adopter's background. About the kitty : This is a female kitten. She was wandering outside at the opposite neighbor's house. and I accidentally called out to her and didn't expect her to come in running. Just came in and made herself home. She is a veryyyyy friendly kitten. She is the first kitten I didn't had to try to tame. WE found who the mother cat is. The mom came in and checked on her for 3 days and bit farewell. The mom trusts us. Compared to the other kittens we have had, she is the most gentle one. She plays but not naughty. This little kitty is a bit greedy in eating but good thing is that she's not violent. She's quite intelligent. When it comes to food. Knows every sign food is coming. Doesn't scratch or bite...or haven't learned to yet (only happens when we let). Gets friendly with the big cats very fast. So if you have other cats, won't be a problem. I'd love to keep her but everyday before I go to bed I have to shut her outside the house. She spends the whole day inside and at night I feel bad shutting her outside and seeing her desperately trying to come back inside...I'm not given other choices. So that's why she's up for adoption. I'm not allowed to keep her. I don't want her to become a stray cat. She pees and poops on grass.Sometimes she goes on her own and other times she scratches and jumps on our legs to ask us to bring her to the toilet grass). When she wants to pee, her tail fur stands up and it looks like brush while meowing a lot. aaaaand you gotta love that face of hers."

Dog,Poodle,Male,Brown,Small,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Minor Injury,1,200,"Blue the miniature Poodle was found abandoned on the street in early November . He was suffering from skin problem (yeast infection). He was treated at the vet and has recovered from yeast infection. He used to scratch and chew himself until he is injured. He still requires continuous monitoring and treatment for his hind legs as he may have met an accident before we foster him and he is currently undergoing holistic treatment. He is allergic to certain food, hence, he has limited choices in food but he can take certain kibble. He is friendly with humans and dogs, except when he thinks the human is trying to apply antiseptic cream on him when he was injured back then. He growled and snapped as he was in pain. Hence, it is best that he does not go to a home with very young children as they may accidentally harm him and he would snap. He is toilet trained and stays indoor. He hardly barks. If you are ready to adopt him as part of your family, please send us a message to describe the following: 1. Your experience handling dogs 2. The environment you intend to provide him with 3. Are you agreeable to house visit in the future and to send us regular updates Please note that we do not entertain comments asking us to call you back. Please send us a message instead. If you do not answer the questions above, we will not reply you. Thank you for choosing to adopt."

I picked up Coco from SPCA 2 weeks after I got another dog Fifi. I'm not very familiar with type of breed as I'm no expert, but according to the SPCA guys, she is a Labrador mix. 5 months, she grew rapidly. She's a bit heavier compared to my other dog and she has strong thigh. She's a loving puppy and most of the times will be playing on her own. She is toilet trained, poo only outside the house and pee only in toilet. She loves to ride in car with air blowing to her face. Coco feds only on Purina Dried Food and canned food on weekends. Unfortunately, Coco is now alone at home as Fifi has been adopted by a new good owner with someone to accompany her all the time. I hope to find a good owner for Coco as well as I love both of them. Reason for me to let go is due to my career which requires me to travel very often now. I have no choice but to let her go with a heavy heart.

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Golden,Small,Short,None,Yes,None,Healthy,1,0,"We found this amazing little guy abandoned in the streets of Mont Kiara at about 4 weeks old, alone and injured. We brought him home to nurse him back to health and found that he was the sweetest, most loving, kind and playful kitten ever (and i've had quite a few kittens in my life). Now at 6 weeks he is fully recovered and in NEED of a home as we will shortly be leaving the country. I can't stress enough how sad i am to part with this amazing cat and what a perfect pet he will be. If it was up to me I would most certainly keep him. We were looking at shelters to drop him to but i would feel much better placing him directly with a new owner. The most important thing to us is to find him an equally loving family to take him in. He is a tiny little guy. Pale golden cream tabby with white paws and belly. Right now his eyes are blue but they will probably develop as he matures. He is fully potty trained and is on a diet of baby cat food mixed with warm water (to soften it). Personality wise, he is very adaptable. We pulled him off the streets scared and untrained and within a day he figured out the cat box. Within two days he was coming over to sit on our laps and cuddle! As with most kittens his age he is playful but tends to entertain himself. He LOVES pets and will spend hours with you purring away with any attention you give him. Please contact me if you are at all interested. Time is of the essence! we will be leaving in less than two weeks! I'm happy to send more pictures/videos and even set up a time for you to meet him."

Dog,Mixed Breed,Female,Black,Medium,Short,No,No,No,Healthy,1,0,"Hello everybody! My name is Winnie. My rescuers named me that because I look like a bear! So Winnie the Pooh was the inspiration for my name. Just like Mr.Pooh, I'm adventurous and very loving! I can't stop wagging my tail when i hear my name being called! Can I be your furever friend? _______________________________ Back story, we feed a bunch of strays in our area and did not manage to get one of the female dogs to be spayed in time so out pop-ed 5 little angles. We are still struggling to get our older foster dogs adopted so we thought it would be okay to leave this family where they were. But the weather was very unkind and it rained during most of the night. As a result, this furry family ended up not having a warm place to sleep at night so we decided to take them in, give them whatever we can. Unfornutely, 2 of the puppies did not make it. RIP. However, we have 3 very strong and bright puppies up for adoption, Winnie, Oreo and Minnie! They were born on June 29th (which makes them a month old today!) The mummy, QT Pie is also up for adoption! For more info, please contact Kelly Tan (preferably whatsapp) Thank you and have a great day!"

I fostered her and now she is currently being fostered by my cousin. She's very small and playful. her bites aren't painful (to me). Scratches just feel like feathers falling on you. She's currently being fed soft food and milk. She has already been taken to the vet and taken her medicine but we will take her to the vet on the 12th of June again to be absolutely sure she is worm-free. I don't know for how long my cousin can keep her :/ hoping to find a loving owner for her as soon as possible. If interested, you can contact me or Nicole (rescuer) at :) P.S. she is extremely cute."

My lab-mixed mom said my father could be a dachshund, hence, the short legs and long tongue. She gave birth to 10 of us. 1 sister died during birth. My current fosterers managed to give away 5 of my siblings to loving families and are planning to keep my mum and my sister. My neighbours are not too happy with us being around and they’ve called the council a few times to take us away. So me and my other 2 sisters need to be re-homed soon as we are growing older as well. I can walk on leash but don’t quite like car rides. I don’t do ‘my business’ everywhere but on the grass or designated areas by my owners only. For now, I can sit before eating but I am easily trainable to do tricks or potty training. Pweese take me with you and shower me your love.. I’m waiting positively. "

Cat,Tabby,Female,Black,Medium,Medium,No,No,No,Healthy,1,0,"Hi, I have another adult female cat who had babies. They're all about 6 weeks old now so they should be able to be given away. This would probably be my last batch of kittens since I would finally want to spay my cat after this. I would like to keep them, but my current circumstances does allow me to so I'm hoping to find interested pet lovers. This one is called Pepa or Pepper, another spice name. She's pretty chill kitten, doesn't run around much, but is pretty friendly and likes to play with her 'twin', Orey. The difference between her and Orey is she has brownish color on her legs. Orey can already eat wet food and a bit of dried food, so food wise, it shouldn't be too much of a problem. If you can, maybe get one pack of kitten milk and feed her that until it finishes. I'm currently training her and her siblings to use the litter box and it seems that they know where to do their business now so that's good. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me. Unfortunately I don't have whatsapp, but if you need any additional pictures to be sent, please let me know your emails and I'll send them over."

Check out their recent adoption event album for other dogs/cats available for adoption: -------------------------------------------------- ""Hiya, they call me Kruppy for now. My stray mama sought shelter in a house and gave birth to me and siblings on 28 March . The landlord found out and after getting nipped by my mama who was only trying to protect us, he got angry and threatened to have my whole family put to sleep. Luckily two kind ladies agreed to foster us. I'm a smart chap who's already learning how to pee and poo on the grass. My foster mama says I'm sweet and quiet, friendly with people and like playing with other doggies. In other words, I'm a bundle of awesome and would totally love to go home with you!"" -------------------------------------------------- Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Neuter once old enough (approx 6 months). 4. Puppy-proof your compound. 5. Willing to train puppy and tolerate typical puppy behaviour. 6. Love them unconditionally - puppies aren't toys, cherish them even after they outgrow their cuteness :) To help determine if you and the dog you're interested in are a good fit, would appreciate it if you could email/text a brief intro of yourself, your experience with dogs if any, your household situation (what type of home you live in i.e. landed or apartment, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) and any other pertinent info."

Cat,Domestic Medium Hair,Male,Gray,Large,Medium,No,No,Yes,Healthy,1,0,"This handsome fluffy guy walked into a food stall and was very friendly and very hunger. We decided to bring him to our office and get him used to people, which wasn't a problem at all. And to litter train him,which was every easy to do as long as the litter box is cleaned at least twice a day. He really doesn't like a dirty litter box He enjoys exploring and doing his ""rounds"" around the office and play outdoors (done under strict supervision), once he is done with that he just likes to chill out and look good and handsome. He is very mellow and will follow you everywhere just like your shadow. He loves being around people and being given lots loving attention. He also loves to chat and is fairly vocal which, we believe, is due to Morrison having either Siamese or Burmese blood in him. If you want a quiet or silent cat Morrison isn't right for you. The adopter should have a home with an enclosed yard which is cat proofed as Morrison does enjoy a little romp around the yard and, if given the chance the neighbourhood. Safety is very important so that Morrison can give his love to his guardian. Morrison may be an ""older"" cat but trust me he has a wonderful personality and will make a great and loving companion to anyones home. Do watch the video to see Morrison enjoying the yard and basking in being petted and given the love and attention he deserves. If you can't see the video on the mobile app, please visit If you are interested in adopting Morrison please call, sms or whatsapp to James (English only) at or Justin (English and Bahasa) at"

Dog,Mixed Breed,Female,Brown,Medium,Short,No,Yes,No,Healthy,1,0,"She's sweet and easy to warm up to pup. Active and likes to engage in play, but is reserved to start. She bonds very well with adults and children alike, and is more likely to bond one-on-one than in groups. Jo tends to be more on the timid side, but once she is familiar with someone (which does not take long), she adapts very well with the environment. She is still very young, so her personality may change. Thus far Jo's settled in well to her foster homes, where she gets along with other pups and animals in the home. Josephine is still very young, thus needs a lot of attention. She does not like being left alone and does tend to follow you around or yelp quite a bit when left on her own, which can be a problem at night. She should grow out of this phase soon, and although it's a difficult phase, this is the best time to bond and form a solid attachment with her. We would love to keep Josephine but our apartment does not allow for pets, and it is far too small a space for her size. She has gotten dewormed and done one wash for fleas and ticks, with other vaccinations and a neutering pending with vets advice, as they suggest we wait for her to get a little older."

Cat,Domestic Long Hair,Male,Cream,Medium,Long,None,None,None,Healthy,1,0,"“Fluffy” is a domestic long-haired feline. He was seen wandering around the block opposite mine. He could have been abandoned as he was found without a collar. According to one of the residents, she and her neighbour have been feeding him for the past one week. My husband bumped into him a couple of nights ago when “Fluffy” approached him. We have been feeding him dinner as other times, he went gallivanting and probably found his own meals. “Fluffy” is obviously domesticated which makes him sociable & approachable. He is sweet, affectionate and playful. We would love to keep him (it’s hard not to when he gives us that cute look!) but we already have 3 cats of our own. We think “Fluffy” may be less than a year old, may have been neutered and toilet-trained. We would love to see “Fluffy” find a new loving home where he truly belongs and make sure he'll be in good health. It would be a great waste to let him wander into danger and death. Notes: 1. We appreciate SERIOUS and COMMITTED adopters. If you're below 21yo, please get your parents' consent before writing to me. 2. If interested, please prepare the necessary items in advance like cage (if you need one), food & litter before bringing ""Fluffy"" home. We do not provide any of these. 3. Also, please bring your own pet carrier to transport the cat home. We do no delivery. 4. Get ""Fluffy"" to the vet for a medical check."

It was raining and the roads were noisy and congested with rush hour traffic but little nicholas saw fit to huddle in an overflowing gutter with water gushing all over him and his eyes squinting shut against the raindrops. i stopped my car and approached him slowly not wanting to scare him.. it turns out that the little guy was practically awaiting rescue. he meowed sweetly and allowed me to pick him up with no fuss whatsoever. He was drenched and shivered pitifully but as i held him against my body for warmth he purred appreciatively. Good thing i keep cat food in my car coz this little guy has a shocking appetite!! He immediately ate with gusto, meowing to himself as he chewed and swallowed. when he emptied the container he looked at me as if to say ""is that all?"". when we arrived at my parents' condo, nicholas ate again.. and again.. then immediately latched on to my mother and followed her around. he walked when she walked and sat when she sat. he climbed up on my lap for a nap, then he climbed up on my father's lap, then he climbed up on my brother's lap. Nicholas is not shy at all!! he's super duper sweet!! He has a nice long black tail and another special feature; his right eye is half blue and half light brown. his left eye is brown. how cool is that? For adoption to a safe and loving home.

They are able to eat wet and dried food. But for now, mostly wet food and slowly introduce them to dried ones. Denzel can already use the litter box, so he is toilet trained. He won't make too much mess. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me.

It's difficult to tell them apart as their coat colour and pattern are exactly the same but looking at their eyes, you will be able to differentiate both the kittens. - They have dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM September (RM12) at a total cost of RM30. - They have been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding them with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - Their weights are 0.55kg & 0.65kg as at 12 September . - They're eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - They drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kittens to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage their health and shorten their life. - They're toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - Their poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as their overall health. - Aura & Solar have been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM85. - Aura & Solar's behaviour is perfect as pets as they're completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. They would purr happily when held. They are friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept them too) as they're well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The kittens must be adopted together because they keep each other company (and out of trouble). 2) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Their future when you return to your home country. 3) They must be kept indoors at all times. 4) Vaccinate them yearly to protect against diseases. 5) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 6) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover their vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Aura & Solar. If possible, please adopt Aura & Solar at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Aura & Solar, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. Looking forward to hearing from you! :)"

The mom came up to me and literally grab my hand with both her front paws as if begging me to help her. Brought Bud and his siblings to a vet. But was advised not to jab due to stress after just rescue. Fleas and maggot invested. Brought home and de-fleas with Frontline and eradicated the maggots. Now fleas and maggots free and happy. Waiting for an angel to provide love and care. Today, July , Buddy had been adopted by Mr. PC Khong. Thank you Mr. Khong for giving a better home for Buddy."

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Brown,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,1,0,"He's called Yoda because when I found him hiding above a tire under the car engine in the 1Utama car park on 27 May , he was just skin and bones and all big ears and eyes. The name proved to be very apt because he turns out to have tons of attitude, spirit and fortitude. He may be a scrawny under nourished little kitty, but he remains healthy, strong, curious and brave. And from the first day itself, he understands that he's been saved and shows his gratitude by giving head bonks, purrs and belly rolls. Therefore, he is suitable for a person who wants a cat with intelligence and a strong personality with an instinct to protect what he considers as his. Some important info: * His weight on 27 May when he was found was grams. * De-flea and de-worm treatment was done on 27 May. * Vaccination was done on 2 June . Another de-worming was given. On this date, his weight was grams. * Next vaccination is 2 July . The adopter has to make sure his 2nd vaccination is given on time. * Litter box trained. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure he gets a good chance at a long healthy life. Please email or sms me if you are interested to adopt. Give your name and the reason why you want to adopt. Yoda is a very special kitty, so I would inquire some details from you first."

Maybe that's why she went bonkers and fought with B1 in the middle of the night on 30/9/17. First time I see pups fight like adult dogs. Couldn't separate them until I took the hose over and blasted at them. Had to hose them down twice. Then I had to take B1 over for the night and she got grounded in my toilet.

Cat,Domestic Medium Hair,Male,Black,Medium,Medium,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,1,0,"Hi, I'm looking for a home to adopt Winky, a 4-month old male kitten. He is a curious and smart black kitten that loves to play with paper balls and burrows into plastic bags. He loves a lot of TLC and pampering. He really, really likes to be near people. Sometimes, I think Winky craves the human touch as he tends to follow me around or choose to sleep close to me. I have to give him up as the place I'm moving to is not pet-friendly. Winky has had his vaccine for the year, has also been de-wormed. Winky comes with the following items: Kitty litter tray, kitty litter scoop, shampoo, scratchbox, toys, leftover unopened cat food, leftover cat litter, nail clipper, kitty carrier, basket (which he doesn't sleep in usually), food/water bowl.

Rescued on a rainy Christmas afternoon at a street junction in Petaling (Friday). After a brief moment of petting, the darling decided simply to 'adopt' us, she kept tagging along wherever we went. (It's like she knew it HAD to be me, that i'd finally give in to such temptations and take her with me). I can be such a kitty magnet at times... This lady is extremely sweet and manja. I don't think she's had much attention from anyone during her life on the streets. Thus, i'd prefer it if she's able to go to a new home where she'd have other kitts to play around with...either that or lots and LOTS of human attention :] She's able to take solids already (currently on RC Kitten diet) and is clever with the litterbox.

We're cooperated with some vet clinics to get discount medical fees for adopted pets. Little Pudding is looking for a home sweet home! Pudding is a cute, sweet and friendly dog, she's not those very naughty type of pup and most of the time she can play by her own and she do not really like to play with other dogs. Pudding was found days ago beside a huge rubbish bins and was hiding under an abandoned sofa, was barking fiercely to us out of fear. We heard from the residents there that she was there for three days and some kind hearted kids there offered her some foods and drinks. We strongly feel that she was being ABANDONED there as we've already spayed all the female street dogs around that area and there's no newcoming mommy dog, and Pudding stayed at that area for three days without moving to other places to look for foods (there's no coffee shop near to her) and apparently she's waiting for someone. Pudding found with lots of fleas, tangled hair and some minor wounds. We've defleas her, do her some simple grooming and treat her wound. But after fostering her for days we found a weird behavior of Pudding - she used to pee and poo inside the cage even when the door of the cage is opened and even after a long time of playing time at the garden, and she can stay really quiet inside the cage unlike other puppy who do not like to be caged. We strongly suspect again that she was being caged all the time before she was being abandoned. What kind of life she was having previously? We really can't imagine that. And so we must find a owner who really love her, and also patient enough to correct her toilet manner. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - No tying/caging for long period - On leash when bring her out - Keep her indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat her like your own precious family members Please give a home to Pudding ♥"

He was trained to play rough by a muscular Judo Master. He acts like dog. Whenever he's tired or nervous, he'll start to breath fast, and stuck his tongue out, like a dog. Juliane (his owner) took Boy home for the first time, Boy barks. Later then he learns to meow. Other than Boy, there's Kate. She has nerve problem. Her brain deteriorates day by day and now Juliane focus on Kate who needs full attention. Every time Kate gets panic attack, that's when the brain will slowly damage. So the more panic attack Kate gets, the more brain damage she'll suffer. Because of Kate's condition, moreover Kate can't see other cat else she'll start to get panic, Juliane decide to put Boy for adoption. Boy is at my place (Bubu's Shelter) now. Though he's big, he's domesticate. When he bonds with you, he'll start suckle your palm. That's how he shows affection. I've train him not to play with human hands, but sometimes he does. But he's a fast learner, so if you show that you're angry when he bites your hand or feet, he'll understand his mistake and stop doing it. So whenever he's hyper, make sure you have toys for him. He has also learn how to socialize. Adopter criteria: I need someone who's confident handling him.

Dog,Labrador Retriever,Female,Yellow,Large,Short,None,None,None,Serious Injury,1,0,"'Old doesn't make one redundant'...This is the story of a special girl with every loving name. She is sadly Heartworm positive and will be treated for it..She was officially fostered on the 13th of Feb and will be under the care of a very kind samaritan for 2 months. We hope a suitable person would come forward to welcome her with open arms with a forever home..we know she is at that age but has been through a lot. Can you imagine having a choke collar on yourself, your whole life? See the 'rafia' tied on her choke collar? Yes, I got it snipped off and hopefully the fosterer would be able to get her choke collar off. What is wrong with human beings! The Starbucks trip could wait, Starbucks won't go anywhere. Even if one Starbucks gets demolished, more would appear..But there are billions of animals in need and there will always be one buddy or clara or we will call her every loving name in the entire world!..Just like there is only one of us out of the billions of people out there. If you want a dog that is just there as an accessory or if you just want a dog that is healthy, I guess you don't have to read further but I hope the least you could do is place yourself in her shoes and share about her. I been asked if her chances of being adopted is high. I don't have a crystal ball people, I'm not God either so your question is bizarre to me, but as bleak as it may seem to many of you, I want to remain hopeful that a responsible and caring adopter would come forward wanting to care for her like a child who would stand by their elderly parent with ailments. Buddy was sent to me I believe..God had a task for me on that day. That day where a man cockily rang the bell and asked me to place water for the dog. Of course I would though I was put off by him. Man claimed dog followed him from the bus stop but he was reluctant to stay even for one minute with the dog while I gathered the food, the water? Doesn't click. Dog wanders up and down..people, hah, people were so unkind in general. I could go 'excuse me sir, excuse me, excuse me maam' and what? They just ignored me. To top it off, employer appeared displeased with the dog's presence, but adviced on placing food at the bus stop and just letting her wander off. If one knows me well enough, such 'advices' goes into into my left ear, out through my right ear. I made calls in secrecy. Managed to find a neighbour of this kind couple who housed her for two nights. 8 am the next day, I had to collect her. Would be at work with me but I was only allowed to place her outside of the clinic (yup, I work in an animal clinic indeed). Imagine the scorching heat, imagine the thunder, the rain and I couldn't. Mind you, couldn't even board her. Not because I had no money. I was simply not allowed to. As shitty as that was, good thing, I went by what I stood for and I wasn't a moron to listen to such advices. I've my own personal values. I would have slept with her outside of the clinic at night if that was what it took even because no way was I going to leave her to fend for herself. Thankfully a kind lady contacted me through the internet and agreed to foster her for 2 months. So again fellow Malaysians or expats or people holidaying here etc, before you go for your next Starbucks fix or debating on what clothes to buy, please take a moment and reflect on this. The fosterer and me are really hoping we could find a suitable person to give her a permanent home...We want the end of her days to be filled with love, compassion... If you are that person, please contact me Yasmin at. Its best for you to sms me first because I work such long hours. More pictures and any necessary updates will be provided. We can't predict what will happen within this two month period but..we do need fosterers as a back up.. So please, we could end up like Clara..alone, lost, left to wander about when we're old, hoping for the mercy of another human being. Think about it. Someday, we could be sitting outside of Starbucks, begging for dough..from the outside, looking in and all of the 'too caught up with the Starbucks buzz' people who reminded you of yourself when you were younger would all turn a blind eye at you and hey, remember back then that dog you didn't want to give your time for? Reality would blow you real hard when you see a dog wandering on the streets, comforting you. Just think about it. Its no Hollywood script. Its reality. Think about it. If what I just wrote does hit you somewhere, then hit me up. Otherwise, just turn the page. Kindly, Yasmin"

Due to the small space, one of them would always end up sleeping on the dirty litter, or topple their water and food bowls - which were not replaced. I We could not bare to watch anymore, so we pestered the owner to give them to us. We felt that it is better for them to be with someone else, or roam around the streets to find their food rather than being kept like prisoners in their cage. They were hungry and smelly when we took them and would purr contentedly as soon as we touch them.

Cat,Tabby,Female,Brown,Medium,Short,No,Yes,No,Healthy,1,0,"Little Stacey was a stray kitten that had been wandering the streets for roughly a week. I know because she has the loudest mews and I can hear her a few houses away. She was sleeping under cars, ON car tires and IN car engines far too much for my comfort. I keep worrying that she might get trapped in there or get run over one day. So I decided to rescue her and try to find a new home for her. Little Stacey was a lost kitten I think, there weren't other kittens and no female cats around that could look like her momma. She was always alone under cars or in drains. Stacey is a feisty little thing, she will hiss at strangers, but will not usually bite or fight back. She is a very vocal kitten, hyperactive and loves to play with anything and everything. Stacey can be manja at times but most of the time she will prefer to run around curiously to explore every nook and cranny. She had been dewormed, but not vaccinated. Litter trained, and eats Fussy cat wet food + Acana kibbles. Stacey is a brown tabby with no tabby markings on her body, just on the head, legs and tail. The tips of her ears are black, so is her tail, which I suspect is from a Siamese heritage. She has white paws, which is very cute. :) If interested, please e-mail me at or SMS me at.

Dog,Mixed Breed,Male,Brown,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,1,0,"2-year old male mixed breed Rosco up for adoption! Neutered, dewormed, vaccinated. Gorgeous mix of colours. He was rescued off the streets as a puppy with his brother and was sent to a shelter. His brother was adopted and since then Rosco grew up alone in a noisy hectic place. He is the sweetest and friendliest dog ever and the only reason why he hasn't been adopted by any dog lover is that he doesn't get along with other dogs. With humans, he is an absolute angel. Friendly, playful, smart, obedient. But somehow, volunteers have been working really hard to get him over his only vice (hostile to other dogs) and haven't been successful. Hence, he urgently needs a loving home whereby he will be only dog and will be showered w TLC and cuddles. He would be a great companion and pet for anyone as long as he is the only dog in the house. He is a real sweetheart and even has a heart on his forehead! Please PM me if you want to adopt this darling and help share and spread the word to anyone you know who's had dogs, but doesn't have one at the moment and wants one and only one now :)"
Dog,Pekingese,Male,Brown,Small,Short,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,1,0,"Hugo is a larger-than-life dog. Always bubbly and always cheerful. Gets along with most dogs, although he has to be the alpha (so if you already have a very dominant dog at home, Hugo is not for you). Hugo can get along with cats and young children. Hugo weighs in at 9 kgs so he can be easily carried around although he's not a handbag dog. Hugo may have a deformed leg from an old fracture, but he never lets this get to him. I assure you he can run fine, pee and poo fine and play fine. His mobility isn't affected by his deformity at all. Requirements: -No caging - No chaining - To be kept indoors only (not for you if you're looking for a porch dog) - Must commit to annual vaccinations Please call if interested"

Cat,Domestic Medium Hair,Female,Brown,Medium,Medium,None,None,No,Healthy,1,0,"Help needed ! Mosu Mosu is a mama cat. Her AGE is UNKNOWN. She has pointed colour. Like the siamese. But she is most probably mixed breed. Has blue eyes. She suddenly appeared where we live. So it only means one thing. She's either lost or like most pretty cats that end up here...abandoned. Mosu Mosu is special compared to other cats. Why is a cat like her out here on the streets ?!? She definitely must have been a house cat before. She is very affectionate, gentle and slightly cowardly dealing with other cats but very friendly. She gets attached to humans very quickly. She has never scratched or bit us. but once when I was unconsciously jiggling my house keys, she scratched me accidentally while trying to catch the keys.No wounds. so she plays too I guess. She trusts us waaaay too much. She got herself attached here and when she got pregnant she glued herself here. She behaves absolutely like a house cat ! Seems more intelligent than any other cats here. Maybe due to her mixed breed genes ? -Very well behaved and understands when we say ""no"". -When we let she uses the litter box. When we close it she goes outside to do her ""business"" I'm pretty healthy and had no signs of allergies so far despite having so many stray cats around. But lately I've gotten really sick. It seems I am allergic to Mosu Mosu. She's too furry. Only the mama cat(Mosu Mosu) makes me sneeze and have runny nose. But Mosu Mosu is attached to us and hates and refuses to socialise with other outside cats. So I am hiding the fact that she is making me sick from my family. So I need someone to at least help foster her or something because I don't want to send her to places like PAWS or SPCA. Anyone who likes a cuddle cat who is gentle and affectionate that does not cause trouble will love Mosu Mosu !"

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Black,Small,Short,No,No,No,Healthy,1,0,"It was late at night when I was about to leave from work when I heard loud meowings near my car. I did not have the heart to leave it there as I saw no signs of its mother nearby. So I took it home and fed it with some food and gave it a quick wash. I went to the vet next day and bought a bottle and milk for cats and it has been drinking from the bottle. Not only is he playful and adorable, he is also quite clever as he has been pee-ing at the same place (in a shoe box laid with newspapers). He is always cleaned afterwards. A very friendly and active little guy, purrs almost all the time now especially after being fed (even knows where he can get his milk from!). Unfortunately, my wife and I are not able to look after him as we are both working until late night. We would like to find a home for this little guy, with or without a foster mother cat, as he can already be fed using a bottle, and can already eat soft food. As much as we are already attached to this little fella, we know that being in a house with caring people to look after him, he'd be much better off without a couple of busy people like us. And we would be happy to see him grow with love and become a handsome cat. ----- Updating again after we gave Sim away to his new family. My husband and I cried our eyes out from missing him last night. I still feel all choked up when I look at his pictures and videos. The night my husband brought him in, we didn't have anything suitable to feed a kitten with but an ikan goreng. As desperate as he was, we had to give him something to eat, so ikan goreng it was. And a few drops of Dutch Lady's full cream milk. The next day, we had only planned to drop him at a local vet, in hoping that a good samaritan would take him in, but the clerk said they don't take animals in, so we ended up buying the little fella a bottle and 2 boxes of milk for cats. Since then we had been feeding him the milk. We left Sim at home and when we came back later that night, we saw him sitting quietly at one spot. And we also saw spots of white vomit and yellow-ish liquidy stool. After immediately cleaning him up, Sim looked sleepy. I thought he might be tired from vomiting like humans would. So I wrapped him up and cuddled him. After a while, I thought something was strange about him. Usually he would wake up if there was even a slight movement, this time he didn't even stir. I also noticed that he squirted liquid from his rectum while he was sleeping. It was night, no vets would still be open. So I read up a website, at which describes a condition of a kitten from its stool and urine's color and texture. I suspected that he might be suffering from food poisoning (the ikan goreng and the Dutch Lady milk). I was devastated thinking that Sim might not last that night as his body was so weak, his head just lolled if unsupported, his paws were almost cold, all the signs I though that he was really dying. I couldn't bear the thought of seeing him die all by myself as my husband was at work at that time. All I could do that night was rub him to keep him warm and pray that he'd be ok. I was already so smitten by this kitten, although we couldn't keep it, I really wanted it to live. Miraculously, my prayers were answered when Sim suddenly got up, eyes wide open and started roaming the room. I was like ""were you playing tricks on me?"". It was really miraculous! I couldn't explain it if it's actually normal but I was extremely grateful. I still am today. After the gruesome experience, we went the extra mile to look after him, like looking after a human baby. Brought him a proper food for kitten, took him to the vet when he didn't pee and poo one whole day. As it turns out, he was still too young to pee on his own, so whenever he wanted to pee, he would let out signs which I finally figured out that if when he is meowing but wanted neither food nor milk, I would put him in the shoebox, stimulate him and if he didn't resist, he would proceed to pee until he is done. At first I have mixed feelings about touching an animal at its genitals but after the first time and seeing how at ease he felt, it really made me feel like a momcat. In those six days we took care of him, we were quite surprised that a lot of people were asking for him from this advert. For that, thank you all for your interest, it really meant a lot to us. The morning before we gave him up, I decided to give him a little wash. As I know that all cats hate cold water, I bathed him in warm water and he LOVED it, didn't squirm, didn't kick around, didn't scratch me for putting him in such a spot! At one point, I thought he wanted to immerse himself in the water. Haha! And then I wrapped him up and he fell asleep again before I fed him one last time. Throughout the one hour journey to his new owner, Sim just slept away. We really think that he is so much like a human baby who would fall asleep in car rides because of the aircond and the feeling of the car moving. :) Sim Sim... After handing him over, the new owner has been keeping in touch with us to ask what should she do if Sim is giving certain signs. I felt a bit worried if Sim's signs were misread, and all those sort of stuff a mom would typically be worried of. Text messages from the new owner saying that he likes to climb on top of people and follow them around the house, all the things Sim did to us showed us that he is settled at his new home and his new family. I tell myself that he'll be alright. It's weird that I have kittens at my parents' place but none made me feel like Sim did. None made me feel so emotionally attached like Sim made me feel. Though he might not even know us, what more remember us, we pray that he'll grow happily and healthily. Thank you Sim for the wonderful experience you have given us."

Cat,Domestic Medium Hair,Female,Black,Medium,Medium,No,No,No,Healthy,1,0,I found this orphan kitten at a student’s house. They told me she doesn’t seem to have a mother anymore and has been begging them for food. It’s been weeks and there’s still no mother or owner claiming her. She’s quite skittish and afraid of people in the beginning that might be a reaction to how other people have been treating her. Which is why I finally decided to take her home with me. We already have four adult cats and can’t really afford to take in one more. So I hope she can go to a kind and understanding owner that will treat her well. She is a bit love deprived so she loves the attention and meows for you to pet her. She knows how to use the litter box properly and hasn’t caused any problems. We have lotsa kitten food that will be given along with the kitten if you choose to take Seremban/Selangor/KL.

Dog,Fox Terrier,Male,Brown,Small,Long,None,None,None,Healthy,1,0,Benjie was found loitering at my porch gate 10 days ago. He appeared to be lost and was seriously underfed with his bones showing. His initial appearance lead me to believe he was abandoned near my housing area and somehow found his way to my house by accident. He has a very playful temperament and is ok with small children. No problems with sleeping outside in the porch and he does not bark too much. He understands basic commands like Sit and No. He is also a good guard dog and will bark at strangers at the gate but will stop once ordered to. Healthwise no issues other then being very thin at time of rescue. He is now putting on weight steadily and is much livelier. No ticks on him and he has no injuries. He likes to chew things but once given a chew toy no further problems on that. He has a lot of energy and will make a suitable playmate for kids who like to run about. He is quite loving and craves affection. Currently he lives in my porch and is looking for a loving owner.

Due to physical and time constraints, I have had to make the hard decision of letting Kyra go.

She had bad teeth, bad claws, and horrible skin. Even so, she is a bubbly, energetic pup with so much love to give. She is a high energy, bouncy dog, and quite simple in the head in terms of the way she plays. Kyra knows how to SIT, LIE DOWN, and knows how to wait for her meals. She has been treated for heartworm, dewormed, and had extensive treatment for a serious case of demodex.

A sprinter, loves toys and exploring new things. He enjoys being carried around the house to see things or even outside, however of course he chooses when this happens (not a cuddle-cat while he's playing around). When he's tired or sleeping though - he will seek our arms and is the sweetest thing! He's a nipper and tester of everything so energetic homes or true cat-people will be his best match. ♥ He's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Markus must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets. If you feel that you may be just the right person for this boy, please drop me a message with details about yourself and your experience with cats (via WhatsApp or email). Thank you!"

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Black,Medium,Short,No,Yes,No,Healthy,1,0,"Hi everyone! My foster mummy's friend found me in a storm drain with my brother and sister when we were less than 2 weeks old. It was raining and we cried for our cat mother but she didn't come. So, mummy's friend climbed into the drain and rescued us. Unfortunately she didn't know how to care for such young kittens so she passed us onto our foster mummy.. We were weak and sickly but mummy tried to keep us alive with bottles of kitten formula and visits to the vet. Sadly, my brother and sister died after two weeks when they caught terrible viruses. I'm the only survivor. Now, I'm strong and old enough to be adopted by someone kind, loving, and responsible. I'm hand-reared so that means i will be a great companion. I'm not afraid of people because they are all i know. Sometimes i think i'm human too. Because i'm hand-reared, i lack some of the skills that other cats have. For example, i do not know how to groom myself properly, the person who adopts me must bathe me and brush my hair every week. I also lack survival skills and i'm not familiar with any of the dangers otuside so i must be an INDOOR cat. My foster mummy could not teach me any normal cat behaviors but I am totally litter-box trained. It would be great if the adopter has another cat, a very patient one, that i can learn from and play with. Here are some details about me: Current diet: Royal Canin Babycat 34 Dewormed: Once, two weeks ago, to be repeated again soon. Litterbox trained: I use the litterbox all the time. Vaccinations and Neutering are COMPULSORY for adoption. Adopter must pay for the vaccinations and neutering. I am an INDOOR cat. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT. Adopter must update my foster mummy on my progress and allow a home visit."

We are still struggling to get our older foster dogs adopted so we thought it would be okay to leave this family where they were. But the weather was very unkind and it rained during most of the night. As a result, this furry family ended up not having a warm place to sleep at night so we decided to take them in, give them whatever we can. Unfornutely, 2 of the puppies did not make it. RIP. However, we have 3 very strong and bright puppies up for adoption, Winnie, Oreo and Minnie! They were born on June 29th (which makes them a month old today!)

At times, Pipi has to find ways to avoid him as he would treat her as his scratching post. He is smart and also has a mind of his own. Yota can be a wonderful companion to a housewife or to children but will not do well with a working household. I am letting him go as I am part of that working household and he is locked in a cage almost the entire day to prevent him from running out and being stuck in another car or worse, run over. This kitten is super cute and is a super sweet heart. If you adopt him into your family, I only have 2 conditions: 1) to love, take care, and provide him the freedom to be the active lil kitty he is; 2) to have him spayed by his 5th month of age. I wish to visit him again when he is in his 5th month to ensure that that is done. Thanks for reading to this point. Enjoy his cute pictures and I hope you get to enjoy his cute shenanigans."

Recently, it seems like they always forgot to let her entered their home. On 16 Sept, I found her again outside of her owners home with a bag of frieskies on the floor. It seems like the owner has move out from the place (I saw all the unwanted stuff in front of the place). The cat seems to be domesticated and can't live on its own. I took her into my place but I can't afford to adopt the cat for a long time. I'm still a student and always at the library doing research or go to class. Plus, i also will have financial issue if I adopt her (Even now I only eat a meal per day) I didn't named her yet since I don't want to get too attach. She is a friendly and well mannered cat. She likes to be among people, responds when people talk to her and know how to use the litter box. There are a few drawbacks: She is pregnant(I'm not sure how many months), she have fleas, she have earmites, I'm not sure if she is vaccinated or not, and maybe she have worms. I hope a kind and sincere person will adopt her. She is a lovable cat and I hope the next owner will treat her right."

A few fleas removed by shampoo/total wash down and ears are free of mites. Ear mite drops administered and eye cream applied to each cos they have been running and hiding in rain gutters in the back alley, so a bit of precaution since I'm taking them into my home with my own two cats. Tame cos I've been playing with them to let them get used to human contact. A bit shy at first but goes soft and lazy when you give them a good cuddle. Very very healthy and will make good pets. Litter trained in the backyard and feeding on kibbles and able to drink from water bowl. I would prefer them to be adopted as a pair, and the other with an owner who already owns a cat or kitten. Or better still, all three one go! :D Please text or email to me and I'll reply to arrange for viewing.

She knows when she does something wrong as she hides and peeks at you from her hiding spot after a scolding. She enjoys playing 'catching' and hide-and-seek. She'll look at you playfully and when you're near her, she'll turn around and run off, hoping you'll catch and play with her. She knows how to do her business in the cat litre. She has also started hunting for little insects such as lizards, cockroaches and small bugs! She'll grow up to be a great hunter, leaving a house with no visible insects! :)"
Cat,Shih Tzu,Male,Brown,Medium,Long,None,None,No,Healthy,1,0,"How he was found: Bobby was abandoned and was roaming around our neighbourhood one rainy afternoon - all the kids were mad happy upon his arrival. People played with him, but, as night came and heavy rain poured in, all the doors were shut and nobody let the dog in. He was begging for shelter from house to house. Bobby's conditions (health, behaviour, friendliness & etc.): Bobby is a friendly dog who enjoys being petted and brushed. He is also very playful and he requires being taken out for a walk everyday. When we first found him, his health was at a very bad stake. He smelled bad and his fur all matted. He had sensitive stomach - he suffered from diarrhoea during the first week and couldn't digest kibbles. We fed him boiled chicken/liver and very soft rice for a fortnight and now he can eat anything (healthy for a dog). I trimmed his fur the first week and brush him on a daily basis. Now he looks as charming as the ones at a dog show. We noted several behavioural problems caused by the previous owner. In other words, Bobby's owner had abused him and kicked him out of the house. Several issues were observed, e.g. Bobby is shit scared of broom stick and he shows aggression as we wear slippers in front of him (was beaten by the previous owner with broom stick/kicked with shoes on). He doesn't trust strangers (especially adults); but with patience and obedience training and a lot of treats (what we did), now he jumps around us shaking his tail happily all the time. Why we couldn't let him stay We are a cat-lover family and we currently have 2 cats at our household (more are coming). As much as I love Bobby and try to help him, my cats show strong objections and disagreements against having a dog in our house. In the end of the day, I believe Bobby deserves a better/more experienced dog owner. Terms and conditions: There is no adoption fee and no money involved. You could take him to your home as long as you agree to/that - 1. Take him out for (at least) a walk everyday 2. Brush him on a daily basis, otherwise Bobby would have a matted fur 3. Strictly NO punishment in any form. You can correct him if he does anything wrong, but - you have to understand that he was abused by his previous owner and doesn't trust human a bit, therefore he regards punishment, aggression and violence differently - so, no punishment. What we do is that when he does something right, we give him treats and praise him (a little bit of drama and exaggeration involved); when he does something that we don't like, we show him that we don't like it and ignore him for a while. He wants to please you, so he will do anything if it makes you happy and avoid letting you down. For more details, kindly give me a call at during daytime."

Reason to give for adoption is because I have too many cats already, and I have to put extra attention and care to one particular kitten which I bought not long time ago.With my busy schedule I will not be able to care for all the cats in my home as I have a very packed schedule these days,and also I live in an apartment. It will be much appreciated if someone could adopt them either all three together or each one of them. As I really could not care for them as much as I did before. They need new home immediately so they could have the love and care they deserve. To adopt all together or to adopt each one of these felines, will be a minimal fee of RM 30 each. Should you be interested please contact sms whatsapp These cute felines are all excited to find a new home .ASAP"

He needs special care because he has an injured paw. I didn't notice at first, but i later realised he was loosing his fingers due to this problem. The allergy was spreading to other paws but now he is better, he just needs care because he is allergic to any soil/sand/litter/or anything of that sort. The vet said, with care, his allergy might go in a year, but meanwhile the only solution is to use torn/ shredded paper or crystal litter only. For this reason he can't live outdoors."

I was unwanted because I was not good at taking care of my kittens and my very first litter of kittens all perished. I was never vaccinated nor taken out of my home and spent most of my life in a cage. Despite this, I have proven myself to be very trusting under foster care. I am eager to learn and crave attention in spite of some character quirks that require patience. Please read on to understand more about me."" -------------------------------------------------------------------- Details: - Female, 10 months old, mix of Coon (father) and Ragdoll (mother). Has a beautiful white + fawn coat with blue eyes. Character: - Fayja is a very loving girl and ADORES people. She has an outgoing personality and will adjust to any situation really quick. Loves to play, play, play and hardly tires herself at every invite! She enjoys being pet, stroked and even kissed (although not a fan of being carried). She will come to you when she wants a lap to lie on (she will struggle off if made to do so). - Fayja has a tendency to get overexcited whenever she sees humans and will roll around, purr and sometimes play-bite. She knows how to inhibit herself, however and will lick you afterwards. This instant excitement is probably from her previous life mostly caged - and lack of attention. She understands a simple firm ""no"" in such circumstances. - She has a jealous streak around other cats although she is curious (big NO for kittens), will do best as a single cat. She dislikes others being stroked or pampered in her presence, will lay herself and nuzzle as close as possible to her person to prove this point. - Fayja has been vaccinated, dewormed, spayed and given Advocate spot-on. She is not at all fussy about food and is very clever with the litter box. *** Note For Potential Adopters (PLEASE READ) *** - Fayja ""nips"" as a show of affection very often, hence experienced adult owners preferred (homes with children will not be suitable). - She needs a % indoor home. NO apartments (unless you have maintained a cat-safe environment for many years). - Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire for more info, this is for any cats long term welfare. - Small reimbursement fee will apply, please inquire. Health card will be passed to successful adopter. Please drop me a text or WhatsApp if you feel that you may be just the right person to take this girl home. Thank you!"

Dog,Cocker Spaniel,Female,Brown,Small,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,1,0,"Hi there. Call me Lady, or as my foster mama calls me, Lady Smellanor. She thinks it’s funny. I don’t. I hate this name. That is why I need a new home with sane owners who will give me a pretty name… like I deserve! I was found wandering around a bustling urban area. All by myself. My rescuers think I got lost. My foster mama thinks I was abandoned. My vet thinks I was used for breeding. My foster grandmama thinks I was abused. No one really knows my story… no one really knows my pain. Only I know the suffering I have borne. Only I know the darkness I have travelled through. The sad truth is, I will never see light again. You see, I am blind. My previous owners did not take care of me the way they should have. My eyes and ears need meticulous daily care. My poor teeth need to have plaque-remover applied every day followed by gentle brushing. Because my teeth have deteriorated after years of neglect, I smell a little pungent. And that is where my insensitive foster mama thought it was okay to name me Smellanor! Oh, the nerve! Other dogs frighten me. I don’t mean to, but when I am afraid I attack. My foster mama says I am no real danger to anyone. Even if I do charge at another fur-dude or fur-dudette I always miss. To be honest, I seldom know where I am. Being plunged into a world of darkness is not easy. I keep bumping into things and falling into holes. My foster mama thinks it is hilarious to call me Stevie Wondress. That woman needs to get tested! I am old, tired and gray. All I want is a healthy arm to be my stay. I pray that someone will adopt me just to love me and protect me. I am house-trained and extremely obedient. Never will I bark, or bite, or disappoint you. Never will I leave your side, until I leave this world. If you have room in your home and in your heart, would you let me in? Would you spare me a chance to live happily with what is left of my days? I hope the angels whisper in your ear tonight, so you will find your way to me. I’ll be waiting…"

She got them out of there and into the clinic. They’re about 3 ½ months old as well, and have been dewormed, de-ticked and have had 1 vaccination already. They’re currently housed in Philos Vet Clinic awaiting their future family. There will not be any adoption fee for these munchkins, and Dr Joanna offered to have them spayed and vaccinated (2 more dosages). So you can bring them home now, and when its time, bring them back to Philos, and the procedure will be done free of charge. Enkay and VeeYee have short but fluffy coats. We’re not sure if they are littermates, but they seem to be quite close, and will meow for the other if separated. Veeyee has conjunctivitis and is currently being treated for it. She has light grey coat while Enkay has brownish coat with a white breast. They’ll grow to be very handsome looking cats. To enquire, give Philos a call at (don't watsapp), or simply pop by anytime to view the munchkins. You can also contact me about it. :)"

She took the little girl in and nursed her to full health. Unfortunately 'full health' meant that Tara had so much energy! Something my mom can't really cope with as her schedule is very demanding at this time. Tara responds well to her name and is always up for play time! So far she loves chewing, like all puppies do, and she loves playing tug of war. She is very smart! She knows how to hang around the house and not run around willy nilly, though this may change when she grows up. She is actually obeying commands like 'sit' and can definitely be trained in the future. We just don't have the time to do it properly :( She does like trying to bite you though, but this shouldn't put you off because it only means she wants to play! We are still in the process of trying to stop her from biting, and the best way would be to get a good home that will tire her out in better ways."

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Female,Black,Small,Short,No,Yes,No,Minor Injury,6,0,"We found a litter of 6 kittens lost nearby our home and rescued them but we cannot afford to take care of them so we're hoping to find them homes as soon as possible. Four of the kittens are very healthy and playful. The other two however are smaller in size and are weaker compared to the other four. One has discharge in its eyes (which we have been constantly cleaning every time the eyes start to form the discharge) and the other is the smallest and weakest among all the kittens, is blind on its left eye and has a tough time consuming any food. I won't be in Malaysia around the mid of next month, as I am going overseas to further my studies, so I hope someone could accommodate at least one; or if possible, the whole lot. UPDATE: We've sent them to the vet for a basic check up and they happen to have caught a mild flu. But the doctor gave us some antibiotics and eye drops (for the one with discharge). They are also dewormed and the vet did a random heart worm check on one of the kittens and it came back negative. So they are basically getting better in health now and as of today, they look better and are more active."

Jack has a slight case of skin problem on the right hind leg & a couple of tiny patches on the body. Probably due to falling into the dirty drains one too many times. We have been applying Arnica Compound Gel on the affected area and it seems to be doing wonders. The fur seems to be growing back nicely. Jack the Peanut & Jill the Walnut had their first bath last week and are still looking fluffy. 3 new pics have been updated to the profile (26-5-13). Just noticed that Jack has a unique chest 'emblem'... the Union Jack. To those curious on how the parents look like, take a sneak peek at"

He would purr when being stroked. He would eat treats from my hand. He would follow me around at home and rub against me. He can get along with other cats.

She was very skinny and they knew they had to help her. Unfortunately they're very allergic to cats so i'm sweet pea's foster mum now. While i was driving to my friends' place to pick up sweet pea i saw a tiny furry lump in the middle of the LDP highway. It was Oliver! I dashed out and grabbed him then picked up sweet pea and off we went to the vet! What a miserable trio we were. Both kittens were weak, dehydrated, and sickened by awful intestinal infections. Poor sweet pea had scratches on her face probably from a run-in with an adult cat. Little oliver was bleeding from his mouth and bled all over my skirt. The good news is they're both well on the road to complete recovery thanks to my regular vets. Sweet pea is about 3 months old with a white coat and pretty eyes. Oliver is a growing 6 week old Marmalade male with a tiny midget tail. They're playful rascals who like to wrestle with each other and enjoy a nice warm cuddle with people. These two needs lots of attention and responsible, caring families to care for them. They need PERMANENT homes. Vaccinations and neutering/spaying are compulsory for adoption. These two have had enough horrible experiences with the outside world. They are to be kept strictly indoors. Will post photos as soon as they're done with their courses of antibiotics.

Cat,Domestic Medium Hair,Female,Golden,Medium,Medium,No,Yes,No,Healthy,1,0,"Introducing little miracle, Kiseki! ♥ Six weeks old, plush-coated Ginger (yes, a female Ginger!) with beautiful hazel eyes. ♥ Kiseki is a fighter and one tough girl! She was rescued from a monsoon drain and later brought to the vets: where she was dewormed, prescribed meds and finally administered Frontline spray. Kiseki had a very bad (and rare) reaction to the (by label very safe) Frontline spray - which sent her into neurological convulsions. She had to be quickly shampooed, put on drips and just when hope seemed bleak - she woke up overnight! ♥ Kiseki returned home after and has been on treatment for mild microspores on her fur as well as delicate foods to help her disturbed disgestive system. She's now in back great shape and one of the most rambunctiously happy kittens you'll ever see! ♥ Kiseki seeks a home where she will be well cared for and her fighting spirit truly appreciated. --------------------------------------------------------------- Character details: ♥ Kiseki is an avid explorer, she's quick to adjust to new situations and loves loves LOVES to play! Her favourites here are our make-shift cardboard tunnels and string toys / balls. She has been great so far at entertaining herself (and us with her antics) despite being a single foster kitten. ♥ Being rescued really young, Kiseki is also extremely human-affectionate. She will grow into a typical lap-cat: loves chest-snuggles and especially having her head / ears rubbed as she nuzzles herself against us to sleep. She playbites but not roughly - she understands the difference between toys and human fingers although she does sometimes get over-excited. ♥ Kiseki has been treated against worms, parasites as well as tested negative against several viruses. She is very clever with the litter-box and is not fussy over food - still too young to be vaccinated. --------------------------------------------------------------- ***PLEASE READ (NOTE FOR ADOPTERS)***: ○ Kiseki must be kept INDOORS at all times (apartments should be cat-proof). ○ She MUST be spayed at the right age (there are far too many homeless kittens like her out there). ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). This is for her long term well being (please inquire). Drop me a text (WhatsApp) or call directly (preferred) if you feel that you may be just the right person to give Kiseki a good home. Thank you! :)"

(2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium.

(5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up.

We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness.

You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name.

All of them seem to be healthy and growing very steadily. Following their mother's size, they are likely to grow into medium sized dogs. Their mother is a very attached, affectionate, and agile dog. I suspect that they may grow into great companion and guard dogs if you care for them. At present their eyes are still shut but they seem to be able to sense what is in front of them. I had so much difficulties trying to take their photos as they would ""shy away"" from where the camera pointed at them. Their markings look like they are most likely going to have solid colours, some socks, some ridgeback-like lines, some tuxedo chests, maybe one cream too. Please do let me know if you're interested to adopt one or two. There are more photographs of them following the link below:"

We took him into our home and cared for him for a few weeks. Now, he's grown into a strong, active pup, always ready to wander and run around the compound. He's a docile, gentle pup with a strong spirit. He loves climbing on things and squeezing through tiny gaps and holes. Always playful and always up for a chase and a little warm hug. He also loves being carried around in my arms. Raw chewy hide, Hup Seng crackers, crunchy fresh vegetables and fruits are his favourite things to snack on. He also loves his dry mini kibbles twice a day. We found this puppy with his spirit broken and his body weakened by neglect. We nursed him to health, fed and comforted him and we have grown very fond of the little one.

Her sisters have been adopted and now it's her turn. She needs owners who will love her, cuddle her, feed her well and keep her indoors. She is a bit of a scardy-cat but once she gets to know you, she'll stick to you like glue. Very obedient and very, very loving. She is the sweetest thing anyone could ever have. Her hobbies are eating (a lot!), sleeping, and cuddling up to the human she loves. She is a puppy that is one in a million. I would love to be her proud owner but I have another dog, my neighbours are Muslim (not too happy about Lucy) and my compound is not so big. Lucy needs to get adopted ASAP... not only because she is growing up so fast, but also because she is the kind of puppy you wouldn't wanna miss out on a moment with. ^_^"

It's been a week since he was rescued and we are now very sure he was heartlessly dumped as no one has come to claim this poor guy. He's about 4 months old , cute, healthy and SUPER SUPER ACTIVE . He is honestly such a lovely puppy . He has no injuries and is in good condition. We are unable to determine his breed but he does look like a German Shepard ( maybe Shepard mix) .

She's been to the vet to be checked and is completely healthy, she's been de-wormed and de-flead and is eating well both solids and wet food. She's also now toilet trained. She is so friendly and loving and so unbelievably cute. Sadly we already have a male rescue kitten who's much older and bigger and they are not gelling well at all, so she's being kept in a smaller room and she deserves to be in a safe home where she can run around free. When I took her to the vet on Monday 29th May they said to wait a week to have her first vaccination, so I'm taking her back for this on Monday 5th June. She'll then need to go back for her second vaccination a month after that so if you take her before then you'll need to do this. Then of course she'll need her spaying when she's at least 6 months old, she's only 7 weeks old right now. A beautiful, friendly and sociable kitten, completely healthy, she'd make a wonderful asset to any loving home.

The mother cat moved to our garden after she got the babies and we took her in to join the rest of our cats and kittens. I love cats but we already had one cat and just adopted a mom with 4 kittens, to take care of 6 is more than enough... The mom and her kittens deserve a new loving home where they can be given more care and attention. Bonnie, the mother is a nice long hair, very clean, calm loves to cuddle and never made any mess. She just got sterilized to prevent another pregnancy. About the kittens, we asked the vet, but it´s impossible to guess the gender yet, so we named them unisex (of course you can choose other names): Oreo is a very active and playful white and black cat, Marbles has pale red and black marks on its white fur while Patches white fur comes with many red and black spots, Marbles and Patches stick together all the time, so it would be great if someone could take both. But it’s not a must. Tiny, the smallest, is a white and red tabby, very quiet and a bit shy. Twilight, is not related with the other ones, I guess someone placed it in our garden. We were not able to locate the mother. It has medium long dark grey hair with a black tabby pattern, blue eyes, is playful, energetic and curious. It would be great if some of them could stay together. But as long as you are willing to provide much love, good care and a safe environment, we will separate them. If you have any problems in keeping them, you can return them to us immediately, no questions asked. If it is important to you, the cats stay in a ""halal"" household. The location of the cats is south of KL near N1 in Semenyih. You can contact me via SMS/phone (English please) or email: kualalumpur(at).com. Thanks"

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Black,Small,Short,No,Yes,No,Minor Injury,1,0,"Used to belong to the streets, Apu/Abu (depending on your preference) is a two-month-old orphan I'm taking care of. Charming black coat and baby blue eyes are what distinguished him from his siblings (we have a cow cat and a brown tabby here) and from other black cats. Other than that, he is a shy, but not very quiet boy. He is very vocal when he is hungry. Well-behaved (most of the time). Easily nervous, especially when meeting new people. However, very obedient in front of people he knew he could trust upon."

Dog,Mixed Breed,Mixed,Brown,Medium,Short,No,No,No,Healthy,2,0,"Hi, I stay in condo and I have 3 rescued dogs in my unit. These 2 female pups are among 9 pups rescued from a river bank by my friend Mark. They would have been washed away by the river water in a thunderstorm if not for him. 7 are adopted. These 2 are still being nursed by their mother in the light industrial area in USJ 1. I hope to get homes them too or they will end up as strays. They may not survive long as strays because the area where they are, is not safe. A pup from a previous litter of the same mother died hiding from other dogs, in the bushes at the river bank. All I ask is please treat them with kindness and compassion till GOD wants them back. Letting them live their life out in a cage or being tied up is a big no for me. Dog lovers please call me at ."
Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Black,Small,Short,No,Yes,No,Healthy,1,0,"Meet Nishi! My brother and I found this adventurous little boycat yesterday stuck in the engine of a motorbike at the Section 17 night hawker centre. We fished him out and cleaned him up, and he's turned out to be a really adorable, friendly, fun five-week-old (estimated) who loves to cuddle people and sleep with or on top of them. He has an almost all black coat with what looks like white or grey ""highlights"" of stripes on his head and chest. Even as I'm typing this right now, he's curled up in my lap. Nishi can eat solid wet kitten food already, and has a clean bill of health from the Gasing Veterinary Hospital; he just got dewormed today. Sadly I can't keep him because my parents won't let me, but PAWS and ASPCA and other sanctuaries I've tried appear to be full up. I'd rather not put him back on the street, though, so if you would like to or you know anyone who'd like to take him into your home, please send me a message! Thanks. I'm willing to help cover the cost of his adoption (vaccinations, neutering etc) if you would need help with it. If you don't intend to neuter him, I'm afraid that he cannot go with you. Sorry!"

Dog,Schnauzer,Male,Black,Small,Short,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,1,0,"This is Norman. We recently took him home from the SPCA as an addition to our family but unfortunately, he's been clashing with our resident dog, Sunshine! They just do NOT get along, which is unfortunate as Norman is a great little dog on his own. Norman would be perfect in a one-dog household. He's loving, smart and LOVELY with kids. Very friendly with people and other dogs - except ours! Actually, our first dog is the one with the territorial issues. Norman is already neutered, housetrained and learning his commands quickly. He's a 2.5 year old schnauzer-poodle mix. He has been vaccinated and dewormed, I have also had my vet examine him (all at great expense) - he is in perfect health. I have also had him tested for heartworms - and he is negative and has been given a yearly heartworm vaccination. Please get in touch if you'd like to adopt him. I do not want to send him back to the SPCA if I can help it, but my family and Sunshine cannot put up with the dog-fights and chaos in our home (the dogs live indoors) for much longer. It's been 2 weeks since we brought him home and it's just not working out. I think Norman would be perfect for you if you don't already have a dog in your home. Though I do not think the fault lies entirely with Norman, our other dog was here first! Please sms me ONLY if you are serious and willing to take him on soon, and I will call you back. We are probably only going to foster Norman for a few more days before we take him back to the shelter :-("

Later that nite I went back to see if the mother came back. There's no sign the mother was with them and if I think back the box is damn small doesn't seems to fit in the mother so I came to a conclusion they were not dumped with the mother so I took them.

I was outside the house at Jasmine Park, guarded area and have fences around the houses... I heard a screaming sound... I thought it was a cat screaming... But then my sister went to look for it and she saw a dog running scared in the middle of the street... On the main road (jalan besar) in front of my house... People were busy going to work, school... They tried to avoid hitting the dog... But i'm afraid something worse would happen.... Immediately i grabbed a pair of gloves and run to the main road... i caught the dog... Fortunately all cars were slowing down.. Probably because they saw me trying to save that dog... That dog was clean... No sign of it like it was a stray dog... Then i asked around... They saw someone, an Indian guy, with motorcycle, dump the dog near the main street... I got the dog safely to my house, put it in the cage... Just so you know, i'm a Malay... Have more than 23 cats in my care... I couldn't afford to care for a dog because of few difficulties.. I think some of you would know... No need for me to explain it.

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Mixed,Black,Large,Short,No,No,No,Healthy,2,0,"Please send an sms before calling if possible because I might not pick up your calls when I'm busy and might not call back unknown missed calls. Or you can send e-mail. These two kittens are Beel and ToraRawr. They are kids of on of the stray cats we feed.We picked them up from the mom...she didn't leave them willingly but they were weaned. So I kidnapped 3 of the kittens kept them inside, gave them bath, fed them etc. The third kitten seemed too scared without the mom and seemed a bit fragile so I left them to them mom, and now a resident of the backyard alley. He seems to be happier outside. We decided to do that because we felt responsible as we feed the adult cats and many kittens we feed just die or disappear before even reaching adulthood being attacked by dogs and other territorial adult cats. Recently one of our precious indoor-outdoor kitten of 10 months went missing; very sad. We love the kittens very much and feel attached to them but unable to take care of them for a long time. They need lots and lots of love, care and time. SO for a better living condition and care we are giving our beloved kittens away for adoption. Kitten's Description :- I'm guessing these 2 kittens share different genes combination. Beel has medium body structure and hair length. More fluffier than Tora. Tora is the bigger species type with normal hair. Beel has a square shaped face and Tora has a longer face... 1. Beel : -Female -Tri colour Fur, fur slightly longer than Tora's. -Yellow/orange eyes -Enjoys playing with toys -Purrs when playing fighting with human hands. ToraRawr(Tora): -Male -Orange fur. -Yellow/orange eyes -Lap cat type. -Eats a lot.Will eat as long as you feed. That's bad. Don't fall for that eyes when he begs for food. -Quite vocal. Meows lot more than Beel. General : These cats will grow up to be quite big when fed well as parents are big and tall cats. Eye colour will lighten as they grow into adulthood. Please try to neuter/spay them to continue to maintain their tame nature. especially Tora as the stray male cats here start to get territorial and fight when grown up. But Tora seems very soft. So he might have been a loser if left outside with the other cats. Conditions to adopt :- 1) Both siblings Beel & Tora are to be adopted as Pair and not separated. One will go berserk without the other if they know the other is missing. They're close. 2) Not giving them away for students who live alone.A family is better. Only adopt if someone will be at home watching over them without being left alone too long. 3) Make them live a good life. :D"

We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Zee (2yr, male, neutered son of molly) and Molly (female 3yr, spayed). As for Nova, he is 4 months old, male, not spay yet. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other. I wish the next adopter is knowledgeable about cat behavior, as it will definitely require some period of time for the cats to adapt to the new environment, financially independent, best if your are staying in a landed property. For confirmed adopter, I can still arrange for meet up even if its out of Klang Valley. THANKS!"

Cat,Calico,Female,Black,Medium,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,1,0,"Hello, I am sadly giving away my cats for adoption. They have to be adopted together as a pair because they are familiar with each other. The reason being is because I am moving away soon and my new place is shared with other people and I think does not allow pets. Another reason is financial reason. I might not be able to afford their medical expenses in the future so if anything, I will have difficulty to pay. The cats are Hinata and Mimi. Both are already neutered and toilet trained so can be kept inside. Or outside if you'd like because they like to wander around. Just make sure the neighbourhood is safe enough. Hinata - Female, Tortoiseshell, about 2 years old. Shy and timid around strangers but once she is familiar with you, she'll be very relaxed and lazy. Mimi - Female, Calico, about 4 years old. Jumpy and alert. Clingy and get attached with you very well when she knows you. There are some things I will provide for you. - Closed litter box with flapped door - Food bowls - Medical books for each of them - Cage I have to give them away within a week or so.

Cat,Domestic Medium Hair,Male,Black,Medium,Medium,No,No,No,Healthy,1,0,"This kitten is blind. Although I'm not entirely sure about that, he acts like a blind cat and his eyes look like it is blind too. At first we thought it's just stuck together because he seems to have cold symptoms. then we noticed him running, climbing or moving around by completely depending on his nose and listening. This kitten has a calm temperament. He is a very gentle kitten and is not afraid of humans since he haven't seen how big we are. He climbs things and jumps too. He likes being pet and cleaned and purrs too. He recently learned to follow clucking sound we make with out tongue and follows. I am sad to see this kitten being outside and fear he might get hit by cars. He doesn't know how to avoid vehicles or anything big and moving fast. He will just get scared and sit at the same spot. Now he had started crossing the road from one side to the other depending completely on his nose and ears. I wish someone would be kind to adopt this blind but otherwise healthy kitten and care for his medical requirement. At least for his flu. Although the flu is not serious yet. Even a temporary foster parent will help a lot. He is the only kitten who has survived from the litter despite being blind.The chances for him to survive here is scarce, especially with the cars passing. Many kittens have been road-kills here. He has even survived being washed away in the drain and climbed out by himself. He's a strong willed cat and will definitely live if given the chances. Someone please save this little kitten !!!"

Much appreciated. --------------------------------------------- His story : 25th May As we returned home from work, as we pass through Puchong we saw a cage left outside the old veterinary clinic of St Angels Puchong. There it was a Cairn Terrier alike and her 6 puppies. Very highly possibly a dumping case from a backyard breeder. Her puppies looks like just a few days old. Trapped in a small rusty cat cage, matted hair, smelling horrible and poo all around the cage. If we leave them there, they will have no chance at all. So home they went with us. When we arrived home, it was further proven that she once had an owner, is trained and is used for breeding. She walks on leash like a trained dog and knows exactly what to do. Initially, she was a little fierce as she must have been in so much fear. After some time, she calmed down a little more. Marnie has got very badly matted hair all over her and very bad tick infestation. Showered and shaved off all her fur. Due to her being around her puppies we do not dare to use too strong of a tick shampoo on her, hence more on manually removing them slowly. She is around 6 years old, puppies are not more than 2 days old. Her legs appears to be very weak, doctor says she is being caged all the time type. So it's most probably used for breeding before this. B2 is one of Marnie's puppies. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets."

In Penang A lot of people will think that female dogs will dirty the place or cause male dogs to come when they have period. In actual fact, once the female dogs are spayed, they will not have period any more (The spaying cost is not expensive if you go for government vet). Moreover, my experience is female dogs are easier to be trained for toileting. The conditions for adoption are: 1. Deworm and vaccinate it immediately after you adopt it. 2. Spay it when it's more than 6 months old if you do not want to see abandoned puppies. 3. Treat the puppy with love and make it be part of your family."

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Male,Black,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,1,90,"Opus (his temporary foster name) was found in my backlane and believed to be abandoned because he was new to the neighbourhood, bullied by established community cats and did not know how to look for food. Thus, I rescued and nursed him back to good health. His overly-friendly behaviour and insistence to stay indoors confirms my suspicion that he was previously an owned cat rather than a stray. Thus, it was best for him to be rehomed rather than released back outdoors where he won't survive. About Opus: - applied MONTHLY with Advocate (latest on 19 September ) to protect against fleas and heartworms. - His weight is 4.6kg as at 26 September . - NEUTERED on 29 June . - VACCINATED on 8 July . - MICROCHIPPED on 15 August . - Tested NEGATIVE for FeLV&FIV on 18 August . - Full blood test on 18 August which showed GOOD kidney and liver health. - fed with PREMIUM cat kibbles (Monge - 33% protein content). - drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled daily for his good health. - TOILET-TRAINED to use the litter box. His poo is solid and well-formed which is an indicator of good health & good bowel movement. - domesticated, overly friendly, very AFFECTIONATE and constantly seeking attention. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 2) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 3) Apply spot-on medication (Advocate recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 4) The adoption fee of RM90 must be paid in full as it only partially covers the cost (total: RM!) of his neutering (RM60), microchipping (RM), FeLV&FIV test (RM) full blood test (RM) and vaccination (RM53). Your adoption fee will go to helping the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt Opus, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience."

My friend didn't have the space to foster them. She asked for my help to foster them for 2 weeks but so far she has been unsuccessful in finding another foster or person to adopt. I agreed on 2 wks, because I know that in 2 weeks I will be outstation. I myself already have 2 adult cats who know my routine; I work long hours with no one else at home to help. My friend is running out of options and if we give the mother and kittens up now, these kittens will most probably be put to sleep. They are only 1.5 mths old, but they are already potty trained and in their playful development stage. After playtime, they still need mama's milk to sleep. Mama is very easy to hold, handle and very gentle, patient n quiet. They deserve to have a chance to live life in a safe place with plenty of love and company.

I would like to keep them, but my current circumstances does allow me to so I'm hoping to find interested pet lovers. The last one here is called Orey or Oregano. She seemed like the oldest of the bunch as she matured faster than her sisters. She likes to play with her twin and loves to chill and relax. Like her twin, she has already started eating wet food and a bit of dried food. Wouldn't hurt to give some kitten milk, so maybe just get one pack and finish it up. I'm currently training her and her siblings to use the litter box and it seems that they know where to do their business now so that's good.

She has quite a long tail and she usually loves to play with her tail, assuming the tail has been bothering her. She is able to eat solid food now and she is not the fussy type (as long she can eat).

Still, she is fun to be with. The reason of giving out as adoption: Actually it's my aunt's pet but her current place doesn't allow any pets in the house, therefore she needs to find someone who can take care of Fifi. I also have my own pets (quite a number of it), so I can't afford to adopt another one. Fifi has been vaccinated, and follow-up MUST BE DONE and she MUST BE SPAYED once she is 6 months old.

It was a tough mission for the dogma has always been around to guard her pups. However, after more than a week of waiting patiently, i managed to catch one of the pups. Please help spread the news around so that this chubby cute FEMALE pup can find a good home as soon as possible. Anyone interested kindly let me know. Ms Liaw"

Dog,Mixed Breed,Female,Golden,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,1,0,"In February this year I was alerted to 7 abandoned puppies in my area. With the help of Malaysia Dogs Deserve Better I was able to find homes for 6 of them through their amazing adoption drives. Lily Lulu was the 'runt' of the litter - the small weak one that nobody wanted. I decided to raise her, rather than throwing her to the streets, however I'm not Malaysian, and due to some unfortunate circumstances I'm transferring to a country that's even less dog friendly, and I can't take her with me (Although I wish I could). She's house trained (does her 'business' outside) around 95%, she's fully vaccinated, dewormed, had Tic prevention medicine applied and has recently been neutered. She has a good temperement - sometimes a little nervous of loud noises, but very playful. As all puppies do, she went through the chewing furniture stage, but has now passed that as her adult teeth have grown through nicely. She has the run of the house - and doesn't mind regular or air con rooms - she's happy in either. She likes to play fetch, and to chew on a nice 'treat' from the pet store. She can 'Sit', 'Stay' and if out walking 'Car coming' makes her sit down and wait for the car to pass. She gets these right about 90 percent of the time. She's fed on a mix of wet food and dry food - and certainly enjoys a few treats from time to time. I would hope that her future home would treat her in a similar way to the way I've brought her up so far, and not to be passed to a family who has the sole intention of chaining up a dog outside 24/7. I have to return to the UK very soon, and I really don't want to just throw her on the streets. If I can't find a home before I leave, then the only option I will have will be to destroy her. That's something I really don't want to do - so please - if you're looking for a well behaved, fairly housetrained fun dog, that also is happy to mix with other dogs, consider giving Lily Lulu a home. I don't want any money to cover any of the expenses I've incurred - but if anyone did want to make a donation to Malaysian Dogs Deserve Better - They would certainly welcome it. I would hope that whicever family took her, we could keep in touch, and if I could get back to Malaysia to see her again. She would come complete with bed, heartworm prevention medication for the next 5 months and a generous supply of dog food. If you'd consider giving Lily Lulu a home - please get in touch with me, and I'll happily bring her to meet you at your home anywhere in KL."

Long-coated Coon/DLH mix with pretty hazel eyes. ♦ Guinevere was rescued while she was trying to cross a busy street. She was very weak at the time:- dehydrated, had fleas, flu and also diarrhea. She was taken to the vet and consequently treated at home. ♦ Guinevere's recovery process has gone tremendously well! No more flu, parasite free and growing fast - only her still sensitive tummy means she needs a maintenance of her gentle diet until she grows out of the runs. Character details: ♦ Guinevere is a VERY loving girl. She's social bug and is not at all scared of her vets visits or new people / situations. She's curious about our other cats as well as our dogs! ♦ Do not be fooled by her size, she's a bundle of energy and loves loves LOVES to play. Strings, paper balls, tunnels, she enjoys them all. Guinevere does play-bite hence she'll need someone who can match her energy and teach her the discipline she'll need. ♦ She has already been dewormed and given flea/parasite prevention.

Guinevere needs her bland / gentle diet maintained and possibly experimented with until her digestive sensitivity is sorted (as much as none of this bothers her one bit!). • Refundable fees apply (please inquire).

This would probably be my last batch of kittens since I would finally want to spay my cat after this. I would like to keep them, but my current circumstances does allow me to so I'm hoping to find interested pet lovers. This one is named Saffron or Saffy for short. I named this batch after spices haha. At first she seemed meek but she's actually really friendly and curious and likes to walk and run around. She takes after her mother, Mimi. Saffy might need to be introduced to food slowly as she doesn't eat as much as her sibling, so be prepared with some kitten milk just in case and then give her wet food and slowly some dried ones. I'm currently training her and her siblings to use the litter box and it seems that they know where to do their business now so that's good. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me.

Please read on for more details about us! :) ** ------------------------------------------------------------- Introducing handsome little Florentino! ♥ Male kitten, 4 1/2 months old. Brother to Demetrius (Profile: ) ♥ This frisky chubby-cheeked lad loves to play! He is the more vocal one and will be the first to meow as you enter the house. He ""coo-s"" before making his dash anyplace and its the cutest thing to watch. ♥ He takes a few days to adjust to new environment but once adjusted, he becomes the extrovert! He adores people and knows how to speak (meow) back when spoken. ♥ This boy needs a little time to adjust around other cats (long as they are not aggressive his way, he'll take only a few days). He's as gentle as his brother and will not use claws harsly when playing with us. ♥ Floren is on the road to recovery from a mild skin issue he had post rescue and is otherwise a healthy boy. He has been dewormed, deflead and is very clever with the litter box. He prefers wet food over dry (although not a picky eater). ***PLEASE READ (Note for adopters)***: ○ Floren must be kept % indoors for his own safety. Apartments need to be cat-safe. ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire to know more, this is for any cats long term welfare. Please drop me an email or call if you feel that you may be just the right person to give this boy a loving home. Thank you!"
Dog,Mixed Breed,Mixed,Black,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,2,200,"These four fursiblings were originally from a pack of five but one pup died after being hit by a car. They were rescued at a month plus and currently being fostered by a kind lady who owns another couple of rescued dogs. They will make good guard dogs and their barks even made the fosterer's two grown dogs retreated a few steps. Kiki is the biggest of them four and he is the laid-back brother he can fall asleep anywhere and anytime even when his head was on top of the tap. Eat and sleep is Kiki's motto. However when challenged, Kiki will step up and protect his sisters and stand in front and bark. Lala is a feisty one she barks the loudest yet she is a softie inside. Her ears are the most unique pointy to the sides unlike her siblings and she loves any kind of food you serve her. Wawa is the prettiest and smallest in size but she gives you a good fight and will be good in guarding your house with her high pitched bark. Wawa looks the most different from all of them and her coat is similar to a Doberman. Yaya is the most animated and active of them all. She is keen to explore and the first to warm up to humans after they were rescued. Yaya is the most intelligent of them all as she picks up cue faster than her siblings. To prevent more strays please neuter and spay your pups once they are six months old. FOR SERIOUS ADOPTERS ONLY. Please provide them with a loving home with minimal caging and adequate attention and care. A dog's loyalty is for life. An adoption fee of RM will be required for spaying and neutering to prevent them to have babies in future. We do not want those puppies to end up in street again.

The other is female - white coloured with black and ginger spots, also have a black and ginger tail. They need to be resheltered as we already have 4 cats they get in a fight so much we have to put these two in the cage at all times to avoid injuries. We hope to find a new home for them for the kittens well being. Location : Serdang"

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Mixed,Brown,Medium,Short,No,No,No,Healthy,10,0,Im helping a friend. There are more than 10 kittens and cats who need home asap. They are strays and the kind lady feeds them with balance of KFC chicken that she took every night from the restaurant. Some of them need vet treatment. Some of them are too small to live outside.

They are dumped at the place by irresponsible owners and she is the one who take care and give shelter to all those kittens. kindly call me if you are interested to adopt them. they are tame and adorable. Call me to arrange visit.
Dog,Belgian Shepherd Malinois,Female,Black,Medium,Medium,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,1,150,"Edit: Peanut is adopted by a nice family in Subang hours of posting. Thanks! We found Peanut tick infested at the regular park we go to at Seksyen 19, after a series of baths and deticking, she is a very happy puppy. She is about 2 months and is very obedient and trainable. Learnt to sit in a day, wait for food in 2 days. Will poo in grass whenever possible. Excellent temperament, very manja with humans and playful with dogs. I cannot verify this but she has many markings of a Belgian Malinois and she seemed to have thick bones and might grow up to be medium sized. Had her first vaccination and deworming and is very healthy. Too young to be spayed but will subsidize cost of spaying if cost is an issue to future family. The adoption fees are largely for her vaccinations. She is very dear to us but I do not have the resources to keep another dog, hope to find her a good family who will give her love and care. Thanks!"

She plays fetch, and we've also trained her to give paw when receiving treats! Her fur is sooo soft! She enjoys a good brush every now and then. And you can see she is a very pretty kitty who loves posing for pictures! Ash currently resides in a condo, and is quite happy to be kept indoors, but if you have some outside space she does like to have a run around and will always come home. In all honesty, she's not great with other cats. She has however, made a friend with a neighbours cat, but it did take some time.. She does love people though! Ash has a great personality and will be your best friend if you can provide a loving home for her. We are leaving at the end of October so just 2 weeks to find her a home. Please help!"

He just got into the pound earlier that day and was very traumatized as he was been dragged by the noose. I was only able to bail him out from his other three siblings. Reason was because as the cage door opened, this little guy decided to run for his life. He was very fast hence I named him Bolt. Initially, he was afraid of humans as he was dragged by the pound guys by the noose. Now, he has managed to break out of his shell of fear and deemed free of all those dangerous diseases one can find in a dog from the pound. Vaccinated and dewormed. This little guy is full of life and deserves a forever safe home. Please do contact me if you are interested. Please call and not whatsapp or SMS if you are a serious adopter.

Julie is the puppy you want to adopt if you are looking for a constant companion who never leave your side as she gets very attached to any humans who come close. She loves to explore and very vocal when she is not happy or want to be carried. Active and playful. Maya, needs a special home as she is believed to have had abusive past and is extremely wary of humans. However, she warms up to you after a minute or two after she knows you mean no harm. So, if you believe you can rehabilitate Maya and show her what its like to be loved and cared for, come get her. Contact me if you would like to adopt one of these puppies.."
Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Female,Black,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,1,100,">^.^< Kayama >^.^< If you are looking for a kitten full of love and play then this is the companion for you! We found her over month ago by the road. She was starving, sick with flu and suffering from mange. After several weeks of treatment she is now healthy, although she has limited vision in her right eye. She is however full of enthusiasm and desperate to meet her forever family and start her new life! I have rescued many cats and kittens over the years and I have to say there is something special about this one. She is extremely loving, yet playful and entertaining at the same time. SHe loves to sit on your lap and look at you. I get the feeling she is genuinely very grateful for getting a second chance in life! Because she has touched our hearts so much, we are looking for an extra special home where she will get special care and attention. Because her sight is affected and she can't always judge distances, we would like her to go to a home where she will be kept as an indoor cat. This is very important. Other than this requirement, she would be happy with adults and children alike, and is happy to approach other cats too. As she will be an indoor cat it would be nice for her to go to a home with another cat so that she has some company whilst her human friends are out and about! It's always good to have two kittens together as they really do enjoy the company of their own species. Kayama has had her first vaccination and has been flea treated and dewormed. She is also litter trained but as with all kittens you will need to be patient as accidents can happen :) In adopting her you agree to make sure she is spayed at 6 months of age to prevent unwanted kittens, and also to keep us updated of her progress. Remember, cats can live around 20 years so in taking on Kayama you must be prepared to look after her for the rest of her life (including being able to pay vet bills as and when necessary). This is a serious commitment and only serious potential owners will be considered. Minimum adoption fee is RM. Any more than this would be greatly appreciated as we have spent over RM getting her well and healthy so any contribution enables us to continue on doing rescue and fostering work. If you would like to visit Kayama, she is living with us in Petaling Jaya so please do get in touch and we'll arrange to meet!"

Cat,Maine Coon,Male,Yellow,Large,Long,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,1,0,"Introducing dashing little Ferauni! ♥ Male kitten, 4 months old (D.O.B: ). Has marbled fur and beautiful orange eyes. Father was a pure Maine Coon and mother a DLH (see final pics). ♥ Surrendered to us with a rather bad fungal issue several months back which he has since fully recovered from. He is now seeking a suitable new family. Character: ♥ Ferauni is a frisky boy who adores people to bits - however he will need time to adjust to both a new environment + new cats (as long as they are not aggressive). Constant attention and the presence of humans round the clock makes this process a quick one. ♥ When he's not rolling on the sofas purring, acting cute or asking for belly rubs - he LOVES to play. Feather and string toys are his favourite and he has quite some speed and jumping skills to show off. He even ""coo-s"" and knows how to speak (meow) back when spoken to. ♥ Ferauni loves being cuddled to sleep. He's still learning to stay put while being carried (normally jumps off) but otherwise parks himself super close to us whenever possible. He is very responsive to being called and follows us everywhere around the house. ♥ Ferauni is healthy (has completed two vaccine shots + two Revolution spot on treatments, aside from his medical maintenance). He is very clever with the litter-box and not fussy at all about dry or wet food. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ○ Ferauni must be kept % indoors for his own safety. Apartments must be cat-safe. ○ Neutering is a MUST when he's older. There are far too many homeless kittens out on the streets. ○ Ferauni would prefer premium food (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire if unsure, this is for his long term welfare. ○ A reimbursement FEE will apply for his partial medical cost + neutering deposit, please inquire. Please drop me a text over on WhatsApp if you feel that you may be just the right person to take this boy home. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated. Thank you!"

Mission Accomplished! I wish to help more homeless puppies and strays as Arlo really encouraged me to do so. Arlo was scared of living with a family after I brought him home.He was so afraid of us. He was growling at me and wanted to bite. I used 2 hours to get his trust. After 2 hours, he wagged his tail first time in front of me. The next day, he came towards me when I called his name. He let me pet his head the first time without growling at me. After two days, he played with me, listen to me when I trained him and gave me to shake his paw. In two days, Arlo and I had became friends. Arlo is one intelligent puppy that could remember all the tricks I've taught him. On 23th Dec , I found Arlo a family that could spend more time with him and could love him. I was so sad when I sent him to his new family. Even though we had just being together for 2 days, I had so much fun with Arlo. I was so miserable when I see him taken away by his new owner. But, I am glad that Arlo found a better family and I am very happy to see the photos they sent to me, a photo of a very happy Arlo. I will miss Arlo forever!"

I eventually found myself at a gas station and meowed for days. By chance, late one night, a human on a routine fill decided to respond to my calls. ♥ I appeared happily out of a thicket and ran towards him. He tried to shoo me away (seeing that I looked like someone's pet) but I followed him persistently to his vehicle, making it clear that I wanted to be rescued. ♥ Fast forward a couple of weeks, despite several posters and shout-outs, no one has come to claim me. I'm now officially up for adoption. :) ♥ Take me not for a weakling! No part of anything I've endured has affected me in any way. I enjoyed my post-rescue car ride and even had a ball interacting with people during my checkup at the vets (I was given a clean bill of health). ♥ I'm downright outgoing, adaptable and sociable (that's not just around humans but cats and dogs too)! I love to play (strings and feather toys are my favorites) and when not playing, I enjoy a good cuddling with foster-mummy. WARNING: I have a deep meowing voice and purrs that will melt you to pulp! :) ♥ I'm careful with my weapons a.k.a claws and that makes me a great potential companion for kids too. ♥ I'm not fussy about food either (will eat kibbles or wet food). I have been vaccinated (first shot), dewormed, de-flead (with Revolution spot-on) and will soon be neutered. *** PLEASE READ: Note For Potential Adopters *** ◘ Maxwell would like to be kept INDOORS full-time (if apartments, must be cat safe). ◘ Maxwell would appreciate some form of premium food (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc).

I found 2 kittens (Male & Female) that need a new home because I am flying soon and there is nobody is able to take care of them. If there's anyone willing to adopt and take good care of them please whatsapp me at. Details of Female: The female kitten is very playful despite she is a disable kitten. She is blind as we had to take out her left eyes due to infection and prevent any damages to her eyes. She had an operation and slowly is healing now. She finished all her medicines and is very healthy now. Her right eyes is blurry but still able to see. She is a disable cat and a special care is required. For now i just locked her inside the cage with her buddy and let them play outside in the evening with supervision. Potty trained and eats alot. She is not very friendly at first because she cant see whats around her, but slowly allow herself to adapt with human. Details of Male: The male is super playful and friendly and loves attention from people. Potty trained and eats alot too. Adoption is only to people who don't have any cats at home or people who can really take good care of them especially the female as she needs a special care due to her disabilities. They are very easy to take care of, we just don't have the time to do it so we hope somebody can take good care of them Preferably take both home because they are so attached and comfortable to each other. To anyone who is willing to give them care & affection, can contact me via WhatsApp / Call / Message . Pick up in Subang Jaya or somewhere nearby. Thank you."

Cat,Domestic Long Hair,Male,Black,Medium,Long,No,Yes,No,Healthy,1,50,"Hello, Blake Jr. here! ♥ I don't remember all the details, but I was a scrawny and starving kitten once, lying by a busy roadside. My foster mummy spotted and picked me up immediately (despite my hissy protests). I was wrapped up in a towel, placed in a carrier and taken for a ride. ♥ Foster mummy could see that I wasn't the type to warm up easily. A single flinch from her would send me running to a corner! Still, she came to visit me for socialization several hours a day (each time bringing with her yummy bowl of tuna). It wasn't long before I decided she couldn't possibly be of any threat! Foster mummy promised that she would would make me adoptable soon, so that I could go home to a great family. ♥ Three weeks into my rehabilitation, and I'm as confident and playful as any other kitten! :) I like rolling over and getting tickled around my tummy/rubbed to a purr-filled snooze. Mind you I can be an extreme cuddle-bug! I LOVE chasing string toys and anything bushy/crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, you name it)! ♥ I ADORE being around other cats too (don't care if they hiss or paw at me, I'm ready pester/follow them until my presence is accepted). The more around, the merrier! I must say I love my foster home, but it gets a little tiring having to share everything with the adult felines here! Foster mummy believes I deserve better too. If you would like to take me home, please contact my foster mummy ASAP (don't forget to read the notes below first)! :) *** PLEASE READ: Note For Adopters *** ◘ Blake is not % secure yet. He dislikes any kind of hustle and bustle. For this reason, homes with active/young kids or crowded households will not be suitable. Single adopters, couples, or small families with mature children will be his best preference. :) ◘ Blake would like to be kept INDOORS full-time and NEUTERED at the right age, no exceptions. There are enough street-kittens like him out there and Blake does not wish to contribute to the whole problem. ;) ◘ Blake would appreciate some form of premium food (no cheap Whiskas, Friskies, etc), this is for his long-term welfare. The adoption fee listed above is to cover (only a small portion of) his medical expenses thus far. If you feel that you may be just the right person to take Blake Jr. home, please drop me an email or message at my number. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated. Thank you! :)"

Dog,Mixed Breed,Female,Brown,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,1,0,"This 8-month old dog (I call her ""Puppy"") used to come to my house quite frequently and I would feed and play with her. At first I thought Puppy belonged to someone but later I came to realise that she did not have a permanent home. When it was hot or raining, she would take refuge in people's homes or at an abandon house. There were a lot of people who used to feed her as she is one of the most friendliest and loving dog I have ever met. She is friendly with both people as well as with other dogs. Yesterday, when Puppy came to my house, I realised that she was in heat. So I decided that before she gets pregnant, I better get her spayed. She has been vaccinated and in 10 days time, she will be spayed. In between those dates, I'm trying to find a loving home for her. She is temporarily being fostered by a friend but she needs to be re-homed as soon as she recovers from her operation."

Dog,German Shepherd Dog,Female,Black,Large,Short,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,1,0,"2 Weeks have passed since I posted Renny and unfortunately nobody came forward to meet Renny. I urgently appeal again to somebody out there to consider her as your new friend. Almost every day Renny gets soaking wet due to rain and non availability of a shelter. Sometimes she don't even want food, just a pet on her head and a friendly word. By wagging her tail she tells me that that is more important then anything else. Please give her a chance, there must be somebody out there who can help her. This is Renny. Renny supposed to be a German Shepard or a German Shepard mix because nobody really knows. Renny was left by her owners when they moved out of their house. At that time, the security guards of the Housing scheme kept an eye on her but she was basically neglected. Renny had difficulties to walk and was very skinny. We started to give her proper food and medication and little by little Renny began to show here true potential. Renny is very friendly with people, very smart and on top of that, in the true spirit of German Shepards, a great guard dog. If you need a dog to guard your compound, if you can provide Renny with a dry place to sleep and some good food, you got yourself a fantastic employee!! 2"

Dog,Labrador Retriever,Female,Brown,Medium,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,2,0,"We adopted Raffi and Bisuit around two years ago as part of a litter of unwanted puppies from a mass-SMS cry for help. Unfortunately, after fostering them for a couple of years, we are finding it very difficult to balance our fondness for animals with our allergies. 3 of 4 members of the family have asthma with very high allergy levels and we are having to spend less and less time with them in order to breathe, which is pretty unfair to the dogs. Both are females, siblings, and high intelligent and easy to train. They are also pretty energetic given their bloodline (Golden retriever cross x Lab retriever cross). They have already been trained to be quiet and they will only bark when approached by strangers entering the compound. They are good natured and friendly. Both are spayed. We really do hope we can find a good home for them so they are not as lonely. They have their own decent compound throughout the day plus time to romp around at least twice a day."

We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Zee (2yr, male, neutered son of molly) and nova (male, 4 months old). As for Molly, she is 3yr, female, spayed. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other.

Only 10 weeks old at the time, he had sustained a double fracture in his leg, most likely from being hit by a car. As soon as we managed to catch him, we rushed Ringo to the nearest vet. The vet predicted that he would need a costly operation back in KL once the swelling in his leg went down. Against all odds, this tough pup responded incredibly well to antibiotics and anti-inflammatories, making a miraculous recovery and not requiring surgery at all! His leg is fully healed and he runs around like nothing ever happened. Because of his rough start to life, Ringo has shown a maturity beyond his months. He is lower maintenance than other puppies and, though he is very shy with strangers, is the most good-natured and lovable dog once you gain his trust."

He was bottle-fed and socialised with human adults and children. Therefore, he gets along well with people including young children. He is a perfect kitten - healthy, playful, friendly and eats with a big appetite. He enjoys hanging out with humans and seems to like smelly feet. He is, therefore often very close to your legs, so the adopter must be always careful to check where he is before stepping! Boots purrs loudly, but has a surprisingly soft and gentle meow even when he is yowling for his nom noms. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-flea and de-worm treatment was done on 18 June. * Vaccination has to be given when he gets bigger - when he reaches about 2-3 months old. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets quality fresh food so that his tuxedo coat looks like its made of satin and silk all the time. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure he gets a good chance at a long healthy life. Please email or sms me if you are interested to adopt. Give your name, where you live and work and the reason why you want to adopt.

Neglecting him would have meant leave him to a slow and painful death. I looked after the cat, and his recovery's been great, but still under antibiotic as the biggest holes hasn't sealed completely, hopefully he'll be healed by the end of this week. I am a traveler, and I must leave Malaysia as my visa expires. We've come all the way to KK to find a real home for him, as I am not allowed to cross into other country with the cat. Michi is male, small size, half-short tailed, about 3 years old, and healthy (no skin deseases). He is quiet, sweet, adorable, not picky with his food, and most importantly LOW MAINTAINANCE. It's hard for me to leave him, as he's the most caring thing I have seen in cats. We had great adventures: we hitch-hiked for two days from somewhere near Tawau, to get here. So you can add ""well traveled"" to his qualities. I must leave KK by Sat 11th Aug. Still after this date, please contact me, as I may not have found a place for him. Do you think you can give him a second chance? You can also help by sending this page to your friends Have a look at more pictures of Michi Terima Kasih!"

Dog,Mixed Breed,Mixed,Black,Medium,Short,No,Yes,No,Healthy,2,80,"Two adorable puppies were rescued off the streets with their Mommy. The Mommy has a home now, but the owner doesn't want the puppies. If you can give them a home, a nice loving home it will be great. These two are siblings and they get along really well. It would be best if you can take them both in. They are loving, boisterous darlings that just need someone to love them back. Even at such a young age, they are both great guard dogs. They are brave and not afraid. With a little bit of training, they'll make good pets and guard dogs. I only have ONE request. Only take them if you are serious about adopting them. They will live to be about 15 years old. Can you dedicate that time to them? You must commit to spaying/neutering both of them at 5 months old. This will help prevent further stray problems. I am only interested in SERIOUS adopters, not those with passing fancies. The fee indicated is for deworming them. If you really want them, you won't mind the RM80. NOTE: I work in Singapore so I won't be able to answer your calls during the day. Kindly send me an sms if you're interested and I will get back to you at night. Alternatively, you can email me at or SMS me at +65."

Currently been to Klinik Haiwan Ee Seremban, St. Angels Vet Puchong & Mayo Vet Taipan. Low energy, need joint supplements & eye drops. Sushi was adopted in a really bad condition from a breeder.

We took her in last year when she began to recover. She's doing much better now. We have another pekingese as well and he tends to be a little rough with sushi, so we separate them. Living in a flat, sushi can't go outside to pee/poop, when she refuses to pee/poop indoors, she usually tahan till it's too late and her timing gets random, so we used diapers.

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Mixed,Black,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,3,0,"These three adorable siblings will make perfect pets for your home! Paperboy is the most social one of the lot, and he's a playful little rascal too! Cardi is a typical princess - a little standoffish at first, but a sweetheart once you get to know her and she loves roughhousing with her brothers! And then there's little T'Challa - for a cat that's named after a superhero he is a little timid and shy, but give him some time and attention and he'll be loyal to the end. Plus, look at that cute little face! While we are ideally looking for someone who will adopt them as a trio, we will also consider anyone who wants to adopt them in pairs or individually. But fair warning, the kittens are very skittish and timid - we only found them when they were 1 1/2 months old and they aren't quite used to humans yet. They require alot of time and patience to let them warm up to you so if you don't have that then they might not be suitable for you. But trust us, with time and patience and alot of love, you will see how incredibly sweet and lovable they all are. Also, a household with small children is not advisable as skittish/nervous kittens don't work well with little tykes. What's really important to us is that they'll find a warm and loving home and that they'll be treated with the kindness and care that they deserve. Here's hoping they'll find a forever home with you!"

Dog,Shih Tzu,Male,Brown,Small,Medium,Yes,Yes,Yes,Healthy,1,0,"To the kind person taking the time to read this, My name is Oreo and I'm just over one year old, male, pure Shih Tzu. I've only had one loving owner but since she's moved, the management of her new condo does not allow the keeping of pets. So I am hoping to find a new kind owner who is willing to adopt me. My owner has already vaccinated and de-wormed me. I've always been kept indoors so I am very healthy without any disease or ticks. I also know basic tricks like sit, stay, come, down, roll, paw (shake hand) and fetch. I hope to find a new family that will love me and that I can love back. If possible a family that will keep me indoors and not caged. If this sounds like you and you are located in KL area, please do contact my owner. I promise that I will try to be a good and loyal doggie. Please adopt me. Love Always, Oreo P/S: My current owner also has a doggie cage, toys, chew snacks, and dog food which she is willing to give away FOC to my rescuer. She will also send me for full grooming before handing me over. =========================================== Additional info about Oreo - Oreo is 90% toilet trained. He goes outside at the laundry area where I put newspapers. But sometimes he leaves me little “presents” in the house. - I don’t cage Oreo at all so he’s not used to be locked up in a cage. - Oreo stays home most of the time but I will bring him out at least once every two weeks. He loves being in the car and is very well behaved. Never did ""business"" in the car before or get car sick. - If Oreo knows that there's someone in the house he generally doesn't bark at all, but he will bark a bit if he's left alone in house. - Oreo is more ""sticky"" compared to my previous dogs. He will follow you around the house no matter what you are doing. So he's not the type that will only come to you if you have food. - Currently I feed Oreo dried dog food (Blackwood) mixed with either canned dog food or some rice + leftovers. - Oreo's fur does get much longer (can probably touch the floor) than in the photos. I kept it short on purpose as it is easier to maintain. - Oreo sleeps alone outside in the living room area, he's not allowed in the bedroom."

Cat,Ragdoll,Male,Brown,Medium,Long,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,1,250,"♥ Male, 6 weeks old, brown seal lynx (Siamese) point with blue eyes. Father was a Ragdoll and mother is an American Curl (given up by previous owners while pregnant). ♥ Louis was the tiniest runt of the litter whom we initially thought wouldn't survive! He had extra time and feeds from us and remarkably within a week, began blooming and catching up. He's still a midget today compared to his siblings! The most independent and inquisitive boy, he loves strokes and being shown around the house. He follows our feet everywhere! Loves sitting on our laps to watch things (whenever he chooses and not while he's busy playing, of course!). ♥ He's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Louis must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets. If you feel that you may be just the right person for this boy, please drop me a message with details about yourself and your experience with cats (via WhatsApp or email). Thank you!"

Cat,Ragamuffin,Male,Golden,Medium,Medium,No,Yes,No,Healthy,1,0,"Are you ready for the cat-parrot? I found Wonky sitting on the step of a betting shop in SS2. He was soaking wet, shivering, full of worms and with a snapped back leg (it stuck out at right angles to his body). It looks to me like somebody stamped on him, whether accidentally or on purpose I don't know. He was too cute to leave sitting there. I took him to the office, and we all nurtured him back to health. For a while we thought his leg might need to be amputated, but he quickly sorted himself out, with a little help from the vet and a lot of love from everybody in the office. Now he's a healthy happy kitten, with insane amounts of energy. He's still a little bit wonky when he runs and pounces, but basically he's % tip top. He's very affectionate, loves people, hates being alone. He's a real lap cat who also loves nothing more than riding round on my shoulders, falling asleep on people and stopping us from doing work. Anything that moves is chased, he'll be a great mouse/cockroach killer. He's fun to play with. He also likes being around other cats. He can be a bit naughty, but is cute enough to get away with it, and he's only young. He's completely house trained, he uses the litter tray (he's most particular about this, was the easiest cat to train I ever had). Sadly he lives in a place of work, where we can't give him enough attention because we're all busy (basically watching him play is a massive time waster for all of us, a great excuse not to work, but). Also, since the office is empty at night he gets lonely and howls. He really needs a loving home, where he can sleep indoors where people are. I wish I could keep him, but it's not fair to Wonky. We're going to get him neutered and vaccinated this week. Please give a call if you want a loving furball in your life. Only nice people who can give him a loving home need apply. We'll want to meet you first, since we all want him to go to a safe place where he can be his crazy self."
Dog,Husky,Mixed,Black,Large,Medium,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,2,0,"For those who have no knowledge about husky breed, kindly do google search about this breed before contact me via EMAIL. Thank you. I'd love to find someone to adopt my 2 huskies. They were dognapped before about a year ago, we went high and low searching and distribute flyers around neighbourhood. We knew the possibility to find them back is slim as they were dognapped, not lost. After few months, we adopted a mongrel whom originally was our neighbour's dog. He was beaten every night until he became our dog. Few months back, we saw a lost&found picture of our huskies on facebook. They were dumped in Ampang, therefore we went and picked them back. It was a miracle, couldn't be more happy. When we brought them back, the huskies cannot get along with my mongrel, they were very tensed. Having no choice, both of them stay in my kitchen area as I don't have a big compound for them to run. I wish to seek for someone who can adopt both of my huskies together (1 male & 1 female), they has been very attached to each other all these year. No adoption fee is required, only requirement is for BOTH to stay together and adopter is required to spay and neuter them.

Apparently, the virus is very strong as it's the rainy season now. I'm on medication, am getting much better, although I am really bad with taking my pills. :P I like to eat but I am more of a gourmet kitty rather than a gourmand as I will firstly, take a deep breath (hmmm...there's just something about the smell of sardines and mackerel fish), gently nibble and then, slowly savour my food till I clean my plate.

Dog,Mixed Breed,Male,Brown,Large,Short,None,None,Yes,Minor Injury,1,0,"Please SMS or WhatsApp or if this is your dog. ********************************** /14 We picked this boy up this afternoon in Taman TAR, Ampang. Nicole Suresh and Elton Joshua spotted him a couple of days ago and assumed that he belonged to someone in the area who had let him out, and so didn't think much of it. But then I saw him standing in the middle of the road this afternoon as I was on my way home from the vet with my Cleo and Brownie in the car. So I raced home to drop them off, picked Nicole Lee and Elton up, and drove out again to find him. It was raining and we were worried about the poor boy. We managed to find Thor after about 20 minutes whimpering in the rain. He ran for his life when we approached him, but then when he realised that we were just trying to help he came up to us albeit cautiously. After bribing him with a can of Cesar dog food, he decided that we were his best buddies, jumped into the car quite happily. Please call us at or if this is your dog. If he isn't please share this with all your friends so that we can reunite him with his family. We have already taken him to the vet for a check up. He's healthy except for a minor skin problem (probably from the stress of being on the streets on his own). The vet thinks he's about months old only... so he's still a puppy. Proof of ownership required."

She is yet another cat found wandering at Zoo Negara. Many people dump animals here thinking we can look after them but in reality it is too costly and there are too many animals abandoned on us.

My dad was retired for a while and had the time, but he recently got a job and will be starting work soon. We used to have a maid to take care of him but not anymore.

Dog,German Shepherd Dog,Female,Black,Medium,Short,None,None,No,Healthy,1,550,"********** NEW Update ********** C’mie, the lost dog from Padang Merbok / Bukit Tunku is now available for adoption. My family and I have been nurturing her back to good health and training her with basic command. Unfortunately we are unable to foster her for an extended duration of time because of our working culture. She has the potential to be a worthy dog, as such I am looking for the best option for her. This shall be a process for adoption, as a friendly reminder, this is NOT a process of buying-selling. Whereby, a second visit shall be considered as conclusive that both of the adopter’s and c’mie criteria fits each other. By the end of this week .. the decision for the adoption will be made. I’m pleased to answer further questions regarding her characteristics and behaviour. As a general overview, she is an energetic, adventurous and fast-learning puppy. At time she is stubborn, vocal (She now has better control of excitement, she is not aggressive) and pleads with you thru the trick of the trade for being a puppy. She behaves well when you are grooming her, if she behaves otherwise, all she needs is time to relax beforehand. She requires a compound and daily walks. Preferably she is adopted by a family with basic knowledge of caring for a dog, a family with children and a family that is inclined for outdoor activities. She would require training to be an obedient dog as she possesses the traits of a dominant dog. Above all else, she reacts best with positive reinforcement. She is more likely to grow bigger but not taller. Her best features is her paws, it is strong and sturdy. Adoption fees RM includes Hills prescription diet I/D (More or less sufficient for July), Ear Drops, Ears Cleaning Fluid, Dog Bowl, Collar (She was found with this collar, would require a bigger collar when she grows bigger) and leash and Dog Bowl. If the adopter does not have a dog cage, I’m willing to provide mine for RM, as it is intended to be donated to the ASPCA. ********** End of Update ********** A puppy with RED collar was found at Padang Merbok. She was wandering about until my group of friends decided to play with her. During the drive to SPCA, it is apparent that she has experience being in the car. SPCA has placed her under the waiting list for adoption. A trip to the vet has confirmed that she has has negative result in both distemper and parvo cvirus. However, she does have an extended stomach as she has not been eating well. Within 2 weeks of regular feeding, it would allow her to return to good health. A treatable physical ailment is that she does have ear mites. Her ears are now cleaned daily coupled with the administration of ear drops. Now that she feels at comfort, it is apparent that she is an intelligent dog that would requires obedience and discipline. She is potentially a good guard dog, respective to the general traits of a German Shepard Dog. She DOES know that there are certain things that would get her into trouble. She will proceed with guilty eyes and plead vocally with you. She chooses to relief herself outdoors, groom herself post-walk. As of yet, there are no listing found for her. Her owner is still being sought after. Due to the extensive working hours during the weekday and marathon training during the weekend, I am unable to foster her for an extended period of time. She would be well suited for an active lifestyle."

Seems to be a mini poodle; was quite furry when we got him. He could be a mixed dog, as he is smaller than other poodles, roughly the size of a full-grown shih tzu. To ensure he grows back a healthy coat, we shaved him. Now, his coat is growing back. Unlike most poodle breeds, Marley doesn't get yippy often. He loves to go for long walks and is outdoor potty trained. We are unable to keep him as our apartment doesn't allow dogs and we travel often. He can do a variety of tricks and is smart; seems to be alright by himself as well, even after being left alone. Loves people; but not so much other dogs. Very calm and loving; craves affection. He is perfect for a cuddle when watching tv, which is our favorite activity together besides his twice a day walks. Looking to give him to a wonderful family or couple, preferably in a house where he can run free. Will pitch in a doggy bed, shampoo, some remaining pet food, vaccination card, multi vitamins and ear drops. Serious adopters only please."

Cat,Domestic Short Hair,Male,White,Medium,Short,No,Yes,No,Healthy,2,0,"Sugar and Sago are identical pure white male kittens.

They are part of the 5 kittens born at my place, so it would be preferable if they are adopted with at least one of his brothers/sister, as below: Saffron: Sesame: Sundae: The main difference between Sago and Sugar is their character. Sago is the gung-ho adventurous kitten. He is always the first kitten to pop out of the cage when it's opened. And the first kitten to explore new areas. Sugar will usually stay behind at familiar spots and is more timid. Sometimes Sugar can be identified by his softer tail with a slight curl at the end.

Only 3 are up for adoption right now though. They have been treated for mange, fleas, and worms so far. Their skin looks a bit sad in the photos because of the mange.

Riley - She always makes the MOST noise! Especially when she eats. All you hear is *slurpslurpslurp* *nomnomnomnom* It's so cute! She LOVES to eat. She's becoming kind of pudgy too! But she's very playful and adventurous too. Likes to climb everything and play hide and seek/wrestle with the others. Reagan - He's the quiet one. He is a little shy, but he LOVES being picked up and petted. He ALWAYS purrs when I pick him up and he will sit on your lap indefinitely! He just loves being around people and being held. He's such a sweet little kitty. I call him the cuddlebug! Additional info: All the kittens have been socialized with my dog, so they are OK with dogs too (small dogs)."

Dog,Pomeranian,Male,Brown,Small,Long,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,1,300,"Max was bought when he was just a puppy and was bred as a champion pure breed . He's a very active dog and can get very ""manja"" . It is best to have just him instead of having other dogs in the house as his spitz lineage and gender makes him very instinctively dominant . He's groomed regularly at the salon and is a well loved pet . Reason for being put up for adoption : I will be leaving the country soon and do not want to subject him to fly with me as Australia has very strict rules about pets , therefore it will be a long and stressful process for Max to relocate with me . // Interested parties please drop me a whatsapp with a short profile of you , your location and your history with pets .

Cat,Tabby,Male,Brown,Medium,Short,No,Yes,No,Healthy,2,0,"A couple weeks ago two kittens were found by my aunt's colleague in her car engine compartment. She wasn't sure when the kittens were placed there, but she knew the poor kittens had at least traveled one journey in there, probably traumatized beyond belief. Since the lady did not know how long the kittens were there, she could not know where they came from and where their mother is, and this is when my aunt called me for help. I named them Nobu (the white one) and Yoshi (the orange one) after Japanese warlords Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. Strong names for two strong boys. Nobu had an eye infection at the time of rescue, but had cleared up now with eye ointment. Both kittens had also been dewormed at the same time. They are currently about 1.5 months old to be accurate. I had successfully weaned them off milk, and they can eat kibbles on their own now. (RC baby kitten) Though they do still enjoy milk on the occasion. They are litter trained, though can still get messy at times kicking litter all over. Yoshi the orange tabby is the older brother, the bigger of the two. He has the CUTEST round eyes and can be quite manja. He is more mild mannered compared to Nobu, but is a fast learner. He purrs loudly. Nobu is the younger one but he is also the adventurous one. He is extremely curious and likes to explore wherever he can get to via whatever method he can. (jump, climb etc) However, he can be a bit messy, spilling kibbles all over, getting milk beards, stepping into the water bowl etc. He has a super cute 'mew' though! Both kittens are extremely playful, Yoshi especially LOVES to play with feathers. They can also be potential lap cats. I used to bottle feed milk to them on my lap sitting on a small stool, even though I don't now since they broke their milk bottle, sometimes they still like to climb onto my lap and I'll pet them. ******SERIOUS ADOPTERS ONLY****** - It would be most preferable if they can be adopted together, I don't want to split the two brothers since they are quite attached to each other. - They must be spayed at the age of 6-8 months. - The brothers must be kept INDOORS since they do not grow up on the streets and are not street smart. If interested, please e-mail me or SMS/Whatsapp me at. Please do not call!"

They were rescued from an irresponsible breeders who force mama Snowy to breed for their greed to sell off the puppies at a pasar malam. Mama Snowy is now adopted by a super nice woman who loves her to bits! Now Snowy Girl is looking for her forever home. Her wish is simple - she just wants someone to love her. Besides feeding her, playing w her, walking her, bathe her etc etc etc hahaaa Anyways, Snowy Girl is one happy playful puppy. She has a very shaggy fur on top but just like her mom, I think it is due to lack of nutrition coz those irresponsible people didn't feed them with good food. Heck, they only fed them once every alternate days!!!!! Oh, let's get back to the fur part. Her fur is quite shaggy on top and on her sides, it looks like its been trimmed nicely but that is how her fur grows. Very special indeed. She will grow to be medium size but quite leggy coz mama Snowy is quite leggy too. Snowy Girl is great w children and is full of love and smiles. If you have a household of other dogs, no worries, Snowy Girl gets along well w other dogs too. As long as your current fur-babies are friendly.

A friend had called to say that a puppy had just suddenly turned up in her housing area all alone. The neighbours threatened to call DBKL eventhough she was such a wee pup. So Nicole Suresh﻿ and I headed over there as soon as we could and picked her up. We gave her a quick bath as she had quite a few ticks and thankfully we managed to get a foster carer for her who will be looking after her until she is ready for adoption. We have decided to call her Dakota as she is so friendly, and the name Dakota literally means friend. She's also very good with other dogs and got along with the foster carer's dogs immediately. We have just dewormed her and she's going for a check up tomorrow. She will be vaccinated after a week or two as we need to make sure that she hasn't got any underlying health problems.

Cat,Domestic Medium Hair,Female,Black,Medium,Medium,No,No,No,Healthy,2,0,"Two months ago, I found three abandoned kittens in a small box on the side of the road. They were only a month old and were quite helpless. I had to buy formula and we bottle fed them. One of them was adopted by my friend but I don’t know anyone else personally who can take the other two. Now, two months on, they are very playful, active, and extremely friendly. They love human company and will purr when you pick them up. I can’t keep them because my cat isn’t used to other cats and gets stressed out by them. I insist that whoever adopts them will spay them when the time comes and gets all the proper vaccinations and deworms them regularly. If possible, I would also like the adopter to take both. If not, it would be good if the adopter already has another cat that is friendly as I feel they may get lonely without other cats for company since they’re not used to it.Gertrude has a small white patch on her forehead while Cake has a completely black forehead. They do not recognize their names so the adopter can choose new names."

I quickly did a U turn and crossed the road to find it was this little kitten, shivering in fright but not running. It was just lying 6 inches away from the wheel of passing cars. I picked it up and took it to my car. The kitten was very afraid of the vet and wet itself and started hissing in fear, but it was fine when I picked it up. The vet said one leg is broken and needs complete rest for 1 month. As my home was under renovation I could not take it home, so it has been looked after by the vet for 6 weeks now and I will pay them. It’s now time for it to have a home and has lost weight because it doesn’t like being caged. It is a very well behaved kitten. I have named it “Little One” and its coat was like Mink with slightly longish fur. Please Give “Little One” a home. Contact Hema."

Cat,Domestic Medium Hair,Male,Golden,Small,Medium,No,Yes,No,Healthy,1,150,"Update on the 18th of October: Parsley has grow up quite a bit during the last few weeks. He had long fur before, but his fur hasn't grown any longer since; so I need to reclassify him as domestic medium hair now, not domestic long hair. He had marbled speckled green eyes, but they have changed to a green/yellow color, and are less specked. Parsley loves playing with other cats; he likes to play on his own as well. He'll find a comfortable place to sleep when he's tired. Parsley has a good appetite and doesn't meow much--only when he's hungry. I've also de-wormed him today. I fostered Parsley from SPCA. He has a cotton soft coat, speckled eyes, and a short tail. He is the boss when eating; he hits the bowl with his paw and stares at other cats who're sharing food with him. All the cats, including my own, stop when he does that (he doesn't bite or scratch though). What is funny is that he always gets beaten up by other cats when playing. He learns fast: When he meows too much and I shush him he goes quite, then he looks like he's meowing, but with very little sound. That's sweet. Parsley is playful. I'm currently feeding Orijen to Pasley; I feed it to all my cats these days. I used to feed my own cats Royal Canin Hair & Skin, but after I realised it wasn't the best quality food I changed to Origen straight away. I was feeding my rescued cats Acana, but switched to Origen when I found that Acana was often out of stock. I also give cats mineral water/filtered water as I don't like to give them tap water; it's got too many chemicals like chlorine etc. The adopter has to agree to bring Parsley back to me to be neutered around mid January next year. I will pay the neutering fee. Neutering/spaying cats can reduce the number of strays. Many cats get killed everyday by accidents, humans, or dogs. Unneutered males can get many females pregnant during the mating season, so please support neutering/spaying to save lives All the adoption fees will go to trapping and neutering/spaying other strays. The cats I catch will either be returned to nature (TNR), or their photos will be put on PetFinder to be re-homed. A cat's average life is years, but some live up to 20 years if they are well looked after. It is a commitment if you want to have a pet cat. Please DO NOT dump them if they are not cute anymore; they have feelings as well, just like we do. Please give me a ring or sms if you are interested. Thank you. Here is a bit of information about cat food: Cats can't tolerate corn and wheat; they cause cats a lot of health problems. The common brands of cat food--such as Friskies, Smartheart, and Whiskers--contain a lot of these ingredients and are awfully bad for cats. Corn and wheat are just used because they are cheap, but they have no benefit for cats. Well known premium brands, like Royal Canin and Science Plan, also contain corn/maize. I'm unhappy with these companies because their products are pricey, but the quality isn't excellent to match! There are a few other brands that are better quality and don't contain corn and wheat, but at a similar price to Royal Canin and Science Plan: Orijen, Acana, Natural Balance, Evo and Feline Caviar(Holistic) all have 0% corn and wheat and are much better quality."

Dog,Mixed Breed,Female,White,Medium,Short,Yes,Yes,No,Healthy,1,200,"Minnie is found loitering at a nearby kopitiam in Sg Buloh one morning nearby where i'm working and sensing she could be abandoned as there was no adult dogs or other pups nearby, she was extremely hungry and thirsty too as she gulped down the kibbles and water that i have in my car when feeding it to her. She was nearly run down by a vehicles while i had my breakfast and since it is not safe for her to be on the street i decided to foster her while looking for potential adopter. She is very playful and at a stage where she like to chew and bite on stuff so the adopter needs to train her and be patient, all puppiesd are cute but requires a lot of patience and discipline but rest assured once they have matured they will learn to be more docile but the adopter plays a major role in this. A minimum fee of RM is needed for her spaying/neutering operation when she is 6 months old to prevent future pregnancies and diseases such as uterus cancer, so please bear in mind the adoption fee is mainly used for Minnie's operation and welfare. As long as the adopter takes on the responsibility to care for Minnie's welfare throughout, i'll be more than happy so please give her a forever home today!"

For some reason, she (the female cat) decided to move her kittens to my place. When i found her, she was hiding in my shoe rack, so, i made them a place to stay; a box, with an old towel, a bowl of water and some kitten food. It was ok for the first 3 days.

As i was away yesterday, i told my brother to keep a lookout for the female cat and it seems she hasnt returned since last night. They have been crying for quite a while and I think they're just hungry. In the mean time, we're taking care of these kittens, feeding it with milk replacement.

She found me behind her house surrounded by dogs!! She quickly picked me up and brought me inside her house. Sadly auntie Rebecca is busy fostering 5 pups and their mum so she called my new foster mummy Lynette for help. When i arrived at mummy Lyn's house she was amazed by how chubby and healthy i looked!! She says i'm so cute that i make her eyes hurt!! I'm not weaned yet so mummy Lyn still has to feed me kitty milk. I really hate the milk bottle so i have to be syringe fed for now. I hope my teeth grow soon so I can start eating yummy canned kitten food and kibble! Mummy Lyn wants to keep me forever but she can't coz she has soooo many pets now. I hope someone will adopt me and love me like she does. I should be able to go to my new home in about 3 weeks, once i am completely weaned and litter trained. Mummy lyn wants me to be healthy, so my new parents will have to pay for my vaccinations and they must neuter me because there are already too many homeless hungry kittens like me struggling in the streets and suffering.. For adoption to a safe and loving home. INDOOR only. Vaccinations and neutering are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and Theo. - See if potential adopter and Theo are suitable for each other. I will ask a lot of questions to make sure adopter is suitable. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get Theo vaccinated before being able to take Theo home. Cost of vaccination and neutering to be borne by adopter. - I will make a home visit. - Adopter may have to provide me with occasional updates. Interested parties can call, sms, or email me.

He follows what his brother does all the time. So, when he sees that fluffers and i are having fun together, he loosens up and joins in. He loses his fear when he is together with fluffers, separate them and his fears return. If you are looking for INDOOR cats and don't mind their high energy play, you can call me at .

Very active and has good appetite (both table or dog food). She has been dewormed, no more flees (we managed to remove ticks from her some time ago with her shampoo). The dog is clean and no wound.

We are willing to have her adopted by a family who has always time to be with her. (most dogs are sad when they don't have companion). Preferably: Family Local who lives on landed house (since most condo does not allow pets)(foreigner might leave her alone when they need to go back to their original country).
